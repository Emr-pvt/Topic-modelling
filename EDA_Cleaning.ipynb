people in rural areas in South Africa (SA) rely on untreated drinking groundwater sources and pit latrine sanitations. A minimum basic sanitation facility should enable safe and appropriate removal of human waste, and although pit latrines provide this, they are still contamination concerns. Pit latrine sludge in SA is mostly emptied and disposed off-site as waste or buried in-situ. Despite having knowledge of potential sludge benefits, most communities in SA are reluctant to use it. This research captured social perceptions regarding latrine sludge management in Monontsha village in the Free State Province of SA through key informant interviews and questionnaires. A key informant interview and questionnaire was done in Monontsha, SA. Eighty participants, representing 5% of all households, were selected. Water samples from four boreholes and four rivers were analyzed for faecal coliforms and E.coli bacteria. On average, five people in a household were sharing a pit latrine. Eighty-three percent disposed filled pit latrines while 17% resorted to closing the filled latrines. Outbreaks of diarrhoea (69%) and cholera (14%) were common. Sixty percent were willing to use treated faecal sludge in agriculture. The binary logistic regression model indicated that predictor variables significantly (p ˂ 0.05) described water quality, faecal sludge management, sludge application in agriculture and biochar adaption. Most drinking water sources in the study had detections ˂ 1 CFU/100 mL. It is therefore imperative to use both qualitative surveys and analytical data.

To this end, data from 300 randomly selected farm households from Pakistan were collected through a structured self-report questionnaire. Using logistic regression (LR) and structural equation modeling (SEM), socioeconomic and psychosocial effects were evaluated. The results show that economic status, watching agricultural training programs, newspaper and radio awareness campaigns, participation in extension programs, perceptions of sustainable agriculture and the feasibility of SAPs were significant factors in farmers’ adoption of sustainable agriculture practices. Also, consistent with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), all its dimensions (attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control) affected the adoption of SAPs. This finding highlights the importance of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in promoting sustainable agricultural practice among banana production farmers. This is the first study which attempts to provide empirical evidence using a robust procedure (two models—LR and SEM). The practical implication is that, when socioeconomic and psychosocial factors are well supported by satisfactory policy measures, SAP adoption is more than likely, which eventually increases farmers’ adaptive capacity to the changing environment. Ultimately, this leads to sustainable banana production, which has great potential to contribute towards poverty eradication.

HMM, such as lead and arsenic, can result in adverse health effects for humans. Gardeners may face exposure to these contaminants because of their regular contact with soil and consumption of produce grown in urban areas. However, there is a lack of research regarding whether differential exposure to HMM may be attributed to differential knowledge of exposure sources. In 2018, industrial slag and hazardous levels of soil contamination were detected in West Atlanta. We conducted community-engaged research through surveys and follow-up interviews to understand awareness of slag, HMM in soil, and potential remediation options. Home gardeners were more likely to recognize HMM health effects and to cite health as a significant benefit of gardening than community gardeners. In terms of knowledge, participants were concerned about the potential health effects of contaminants in soil yet unconcerned with produce in their gardens. Gardeners’ knowledge on sources of HMM exposure and methods for remediation were low and varied based on racial group.

The current ways of managing waste, such as refuse collection and recycling, are failing to minimise waste in cities. With urban populations growing worldwide, there is the challenge of increased pressure to import food from rural areas. Urban agriculture not only presents an opportunity to explore other means of sustainable food production, but for managing organic waste in cities. However, this opportunity is not taken advantage of. Besides, there is a challenge of mixed reactions from urban planners and policymakers concerning the challenges and benefits presented by using organic waste in urban agriculture. The current paper explores the perceived challenges and opportunities for organic waste utilisation and management through urban agriculture in the Durban South Basin in eThekwini Municipality in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province of South Africa. It is anticipated that this information will be of use to the eThekwini Municipality, policymakers, researchers, urban agriculture initiatives, households and relevant stakeholders in the study areas and similar contexts globally. Two hundred (200) households involved in any urban farming activity and ten (10) key informants (six (6) staff from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit of the eThekwini Municipality and four (4) from the urban agricultural initiative) were selected using convenient sampling. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse data. The significant perceived challenges and risks associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture included lack of a supporting policy, climatic variation, lack of land tenure rights, soil contamination and food safety concerns. Qualitative data further showed that the difficulty in segregating waste, water scarcity, difficulty in accessing inputs, limited transportation of organic waste, inadequate handling and treatment of organic waste, and being a health hazard were some important challenges. On the other hand, the significant perceived benefits associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture were enhanced food and nutrition security, and opportunities for business incubation. Other important benefits established through qualitative data were an improved market expansion for farmers and improved productivity. Overall, despite the perceived challenges and risks, there is an opportunity to manage organic waste through urban agriculture. It is imperative for an integrated policy encompassing the food, climate and waste management to be developed to support this strategy. All stakeholders—the government, municipal authorities and urban agricultural initiatives should also, guided by the policy, support urban farmers, for example, through pieces of training on how to properly manage and recycle organic waste, land distribution, inputs availability and water usage rights among other things.

A joint field experiment was carried out to assess the role of seaweed-based extracts in pear trees and to test the “less for more” theory, which consists of getting more and better agricultural produce using fewer innovative inputs. The trials took place on two production seasons (from March till September 2018–2019) and the selected case study was on a pear orchard (Pyrus communis L. cv. Abate Fètel) in Emilia Romagna (Italy) by Fondazione Navarra and Timac Agro Italia S.p.A. Results demonstrate that, depending on the yearly climate conditions, it was possible to substantially reduce the primary nutrients by 35–46% and total fertilisation units applied by 13% and significantly improve quantitative and qualitative production indicators (average weight of fruits (5%) and total yield (19–55%)). Results also confirm a positive correlation between plant growth regulators and agronomic efficiency of pears which increased between five and nine times compared to the conventional nutrition programme. These outcomes constitute scientific evidence for decision making in farm management.

Dermal uptake is a known exposure route for dichlorvos and chemical protective gloves are commonly utilized. Chemical handling and application may occur in a variety of thermal environments, and the rates of both chemical permeation through gloves and transdermal penetration may vary significantly with temperature. There has been no published research on the temperature-dependent kinetics of these processes for dichlorvos and thus, this study reports on the effects of hot conditions for the concentrated and application strength chemical. Dichlorvos breakthrough times for non-disposable polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves at 60 °C were approximately halved compared to 25 °C for the concentrate (2 vs. 4 h) and more than halved at application strength (3 vs. >8 h). From permeation experiments covering 15–60 °C, there was a 460-fold increase in cumulative permeation over 8 h for the concentrated dichlorvos and the estimated activation energy halved. Elevated temperature was also shown to be a significant factor for human skin penetration increasing the cumulative penetration of concentrate dichlorvos from 179 ± 37 to 1315 ± 362 µg/cm2 (p = 0.0032) and application strength from 29.8 ± 5.7 to 115 ± 19 µg/cm2 (p = 0.0131). This work illustrates the important role temperature plays in glove performance and health risk via dermal exposure. As such, it is important to consider in-use conditions of temperature when implementing chemical hygiene programs.

However, the identity, functions, and the factors that influence the association of bacterial endophytes with desert plants are poorly known. These bacterial endophytes can be used as an untapped resource to favor plant growth and development in agro-ecosystems of arid regions. The present study is therefore focused on the isolation and identification of bacterial endophytes from two native medicinal plants (Fagonia mollis Delile and Achillea fragrantissima (Forssk) Sch. Bip.) growing spontaneously in the arid region of the South Sinai (Egypt), and characterization of their plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. Thirteen putative bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaves of both plant species and characterized for their plant growth promoting abilities using molecular and biochemical approaches, as well as greenhouse trials. Selected endophytic bacterial strains were applied to maize plants (Zea mays L. var. Single cross Pioneer 30K08) to further evaluate their PGP abilities under greenhouse conditions. Isolated bacterial strains have variable plant growth promoting activities. Among these activities, isolated bacterial endophytes have the efficacy of phosphate solubilizing with clear zones ranging from 7.6 ± 0.3 to 9.6 ± 0.3 mm. Additionally, the obtained bacterial endophytes increased the productivity of indole acetic acid (IAA) in broth media from 10 to 60 µg·mL−1 with increasing tryptophan concentration from 1 to 5 mg·mL−1. Bacillus and Brevibacillus strains were frequently isolated from the leaves of both plant species, and had significant positive effects on plant growth and shoot phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) contents. Results suggest that these endophytes are good candidates as plant growth promoting inoculants to help reduce chemical input in conventional agricultural practices and increase nutrient uptake and stress resilience in plant species.',\n"," 'Species from the crested wheatgrass (Agropyron spp.) complex have been widely used for revegetation and grazing on North American rangelands for over 100 years. Focused crested wheatgrass breeding has been ongoing since the 1920s. These efforts resulted in the development of 18 cultivars adapted to western USA and Canadian growing conditions. These cultivars establish rapidly, persist, and provide soil stabilization and a reliable feed source for domestic livestock and wildlife. To address ecological concerns and increase rangeland agriculture efficiency, crested wheatgrass breeding requires new emphases and techniques. This review covers the history of crested wheatgrass breeding and genetics in North America and discusses emerging methods and practices for improvement in the future.

Later, due to the shift towards an integrated control that has been quite successful in the control of aleyrodids, not so much in the control of aphids, aphid-borne viruses are having a significant revival in open field cultivation. Another threat is the continuous emergence of new species or variants of mechanically transmitted viruses. Thus, the number of viruses affecting these crops is constantly increasing and their control demands dynamic actions. The main measures that have managed to limit the damage of these diseases have been the improvement in the physical barriers that limit the spread of vectors and the introduction of resistances in the germplasm. Recently, the increased movement of plant materials and of people, the popularity of growing local crop varieties that lack natural resistances against pathogens, and the prospects of global climate change, may well have boosted the frequency of diseases and pests. Faced with this picture, strategies must be addressed from a multidisciplinary approach. The need for in-field diagnostics tools, easy access to information, novel breeding technologies and alternatives to control of these viruses are discussed.

However, machinery user’s manuals and road signs report information regarding slope steepness in two different ways, by using the tilt angle in degrees and the slope percentage, respectively. In this study, we investigated the comprehension of safety signs depicting critical slopes, either in degrees or as percent values in a group of Italian agricultural machinery operators while considering the possible influence of previous experience with agricultural machinery, previous incidents, and on-farm occupation. Eighteen tractor and self-propelled machinery operators were administered graphical representations of seven slope angles in a randomized order and then were asked to estimate the slope steepness as both a tilt angle and a slope percentage. The participants tended to overestimate slope steepness in degrees, whereas the opposite was true for percentages. Farmers who were previously involved in a machinery-related incident were more accurate in their estimates. The present results raise some considerations regarding the need to redesign safety communication and to promote targeted training interventions.

Autonomous mowers can provide several advantages since these machines help to save time and energy and prevent operators from possible injuries. Current autonomous mowers operate by following random trajectories within areas defined by a shallow-buried boundary wire that has the purpose to generate an electro-magnetic field. Once the electro-magnetic field is perceived by the autonomous mower, the machine will stop and change direction. Mowing along random trajectories is considered an efficient solution to manage areas with a variable number of obstacles. In agriculture, autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly popular since they can help to increase both the quantity and quality of agricultural products by reducing productive cost and improving the production process. Thus, even autonomous mowers may be useful to carry out some of the agricultural operations that are highly time consuming. In fact, some autonomous mowers designed and realized to work in vineyards and home vegetable gardens are already available on the market. The aim of this study was to compare the work capacity of six autonomous mowers that move along random trajectories in areas with a high number of obstacles to assess if these machines may be employed in some agricultural contexts. The six autonomous mowers were split in three groups based on their size (large, medium, and small) and were left to work in two areas with equal number of obstacles but different layouts. The first area (Site A) had a square shape and an extension of 23.04 m2, in order to keep the autonomous mowers enclosed inside it. The second area (Site B) had a square shape and an extension of 84.64 m2, in order to have a part of the area with no obstacles. The layout and the size of the two areas affected the autonomous mowers performances in different ways. The six autonomous mowers working on Site A obtained similar results and higher performances compared to the same mowers working on Site B. All the autonomous mowers proved to be able to mow more than 89% of Site A after 2 h and more than 98% of Site A after 5 h. On Site B small size autonomous mowers obtained the best results mowing more than 83% of the area with obstacles after 2 h and more than 98% of the area with obstacles after 5 h. However, specific work settings allowed larger autonomous mowers to improve their efficiency, obtaining similar results compared to smaller autonomous mowers.

The improved temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the European Space Agency (ESA) launched Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform is paving the way to their popularization in precision agriculture. Besides the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation technical features the open-access nature of the information they generate, and the available support software are a significant improvement for agricultural monitoring. This paper was motivated by the challenges faced by researchers and agrarian institutions entering this field; it aims to frame remote sensing principles and Sentinel-2 applications in agriculture. Thus, we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel-2 in precision agriculture, including abiotic and biotic stress detection, and agricultural management. We also compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that are relevant for agriculture to the Sentinel-2 A + B constellation features. Contrasted with previous satellite image systems, the Sentinel-2 A + B twin platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural monitoring and crop management worldwide. Regarding crop stress monitoring, Sentinel-2 capacities for abiotic and biotic stresses detection represent a great step forward in many ways though not without its limitations; therefore, combinations of field data and different remote sensing techniques may still be needed. We conclude that Sentinel-2 has a wide range of useful applications in agriculture, yet still with room for further improvements. Current and future ways that Sentinel-2 can be utilized are also discussed. View Full-Text',\n"," 'Flood recession farming is as an important supplement to rainfed agriculture in West Africa. Every year, large areas are flooded along riverbanks and temporary lakes. When water recedes from the flooded areas, farmers plant crops. This study describes the flood recession farming in the Yelimane district of Kayes region in Mali and assesses different ways to intensify the system. The use of external inputs in this system is minimal. Field experiments were undertaken over two years to test crop establishment methods, soil tillage, increasing plant density, use of organic and mineral fertilizer, and improved varieties. These technologies increased sorghum yield as compared to the control in the following descending order: Seed priming + fertilizer (77.1%), NPK + organic fertilizer (74%), seedling transplantation + micro fertilization (61.3%), improved varieties (49%), mounding (34%), and urea application (24.9%). The technology seed priming in combination with mineral fertilizers was promising because of the high yield and the low labor demand. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed in flood recession agriculture as the soils and the deposited sediments are low in nitrogen. Farmers’ choice of technology will depend on the yield level, net return per hectare, labor use, and access to inputs.

This study analyzed the connection between strategies implemented by extension services and technology adoption on family farms. Using the case of the Servicio de Asesoría Técnica (SAT) Program, we developed a bottom-up adoption index (AI) for vegetable and berry farmers in three regions of Central Chile. We implemented 10 focus groups totaling 101 participants, all recipients of technical assistance from private extension companies (PECs) funded by the SAT Program. After the focus group sessions, we surveyed participating farmers to gather information on socio-economic attributes and adopted technologies. Using cluster analysis, we identified three groups of farmers according to their adoption intensity. The results indicate that extension strategies used by PECs have distinct effects on the adoption of new technologies. Higher adoption indexes were positively associated with the duration of the extension visits, the number of group activities, and the use of incentives and credits provided by the Chilean government. The value of production and farm size were positively associated with adoption intensity. View Full-Text',\n"," 'Soil degradation is the greatest threat to agricultural production globally. The practice of applying or retaining crop residues in the field as mulch is imperative to prevent soil erosion, maintain soil quality and improve crop productivity. However, smallholder farmers resort to maximizing profit by removing crop residues after harvest to sell or use them as feed for livestock. Agrimats are innovative pro-smallholder farming mulching materials that are manufactured using cheap or freely available organic waste materials. These materials include forestry waste, grasses, etc., therefore allowing smallholder farmers to make more profit through improved crop productivity for better food security. The most notable attributes of agrimats include their ability to prevent soil erosion, increase and sustain soil organic matter, suppress weeds, and conserve soil moisture. Food security challenge can be addressed by adopting agrimat technology as a sustainable permanent soil cover to improve soil quality and crop productivity. Agrimat incorporation in conservation agriculture practice could produce more food from less input resources (chemical fertilizers, water, etc.) with minimal or no adverse effect on the environment.

Thus, there is need for agricultural producers in Africa to employ robust adaptive measures that withstand the risks of climate change. However, the success of adaptation measures to climate change primarily depends on the communities’ knowledge or awareness of climate change and its risks. Nonetheless, existing empirical research is still limited to illuminate farmers’ awareness of the climate change problem. This study employs a Bayesian hierarchical logistic model, estimated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods, to empirically determine drivers of smallholder farmers’ awareness of climate change and its risks to agriculture in Zambia. The results suggest that on average, 77% of farmers in Zambia are aware of climate change and its risks to agriculture. We find socio-demographics, climate change information sources, climate change adaptive factors, and climate change impact-related shocks as predictors of the expression of climate change awareness. We suggest that farmers should be given all the necessary information about climate change and its risks to agriculture. Most importantly, the drivers identified can assist policymakers to provide the effective extension and advisory services that would enhance the understanding of climate change among farmers in synergy with appropriate farm-level climate-smart agricultural practices.

However, little is known about whether rural infrastructure enables the promotion of resource-conserving agriculture and reduces production costs. Understanding the relationship between rural infrastructure and production costs can provide significant information for policy-makers in their efforts to promote resource-saving agriculture that is beneficial to environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature by analyzing the heterogeneous effects of irrigation infrastructure and standard and substandard roads on agricultural production costs, using an unconditional quantile regression model and provincial data from China for the period 1995–2017. The empirical results show that the effects of rural infrastructure on production costs are mixed. In particular, irrigation infrastructure affects production costs positively in the lower quantiles, but it negatively affects production costs in the higher quantiles. In the higher 80th and 90th quantiles, standard and substandard roads affect production costs both negatively and significantly. Our findings suggest that improving rural infrastructure enables the promotion of resource-conserving agriculture and enhances environmental performance, especially for those paying high production costs.

The extraction rate of natural resources has increased by 113% since 1990, which has led to overexploitation and generation of vast amounts of waste. For this reason, it is essential that a sustainable development model is adopted—one which makes it possible to produce more food and energy with fewer fossil fuels, low pollutant gas emissions and minimal solid waste. Certain management policies and approaches, such as the strategy of a circular ecocomy or bioeconomy, are oriented towards sustainable production and consumption. The present study focuses on the importance of intensive horticulture in the Mediterranean region, specifically in the province of Almería (Spain). After having conducted a study of the main crops in this area, it was determined that the waste biomass generated presented strong potential for exploitation. With the proper regulatory framework, which promotes and prioritises the circularity of agricultural waste, there are several opportunities for improving the current waste management model. In the same way, the results of the economic evaluation demonstrate that the alternative of self-management of waste biomass is profitable, specifically from tomato crops. Compost and green fertilizer production also prove to be a key strategy in the transition towards a more circular and sustainable agricultural production model. As for the said transition, government support is vital in terms of carrying out awareness campaigns and training activities and providing financing for Research and Development (R&D).

Although this field offers great potential, data on the impact on crop growth and development are insufficient. As such, this study examines the impact of agriculture–photovoltaic farming on crops using energy information and communications technology (ICT). The researched crops were grapes, cultivated land was divided into six sections, photovoltaic panels were installed in three test areas, and not installed in the other three. A 1300 × 520 mm photovoltaic module was installed on a screen that was designed with a shading rate of 30%. In addition, to collect farming-cultivation-environment data and to analyze power generation, sensors for growing environments and wireless-communication devices were used. As a result, normal modules generated 25.2 MWh, bifacial modules generated 21.6 MWh, and transparent modules generated 25.7 MWh over a five-month period. We could not find a difference in grape growth according to the difference of each module. However, a slight slowing of grape growth was found in the experiment group compared to the control group. Nevertheless, the sugar content of the test area of the grape fruit in the harvest season was 17.6 Brix on average, and the sugar content of the control area was measured at 17.2 Brix. Grape sugar-content level was shown to be at almost the same level as that in the control group by delaying the harvest time by about 10 days. In conclusion, this study shows that it is possible to produce renewable energy without any meaningful negative impact on normal grape farming.

This can cause more problems where the soil surface is thin and rocky like Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea. This is because overly used nitrogen fertilizer can be washed into the underground water and pollute it. Thus, it would be important to monitor the nitrogen deficiency of crops in the field to provide the right amount of nitrogen in a timely manner so that nitrogen waste can be limited. To achieve this, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to monitor chlorophyll content, which is tightly associated with nitrogen content in the buckwheat field. The NDVI was calculated with the data obtained by a low-resolution camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. The results showed that the NDVI can estimate the chlorophyll content of buckwheat. These simple but clear results imply that precision agriculture could be achieved even with a low-resolution camera in a cost-effective manner to reduce the pollution of underground water.

These systems constitute a feasible alternative for ensuring food supply, which is one of the greatest challenges faced by humankind in the twenty-first century. Technology has been able to meet the challenges related to greenhouse farming in both contributing to overcoming its limitations, correcting adverse impacts and ensuring system sustainability. The objective of this article is to analyse the global research trends in greenhouse technology over the last two decades, in order to identify the main driving agents, the most outstanding research lines and possible gaps in the literature. Different methodologies have been used for the analysis; both quantitative and qualitative. The principal results show that there are different relevant lines of research related to different aspects of greenhouse farming: the use of water for irrigation, the design of the optimum structure of the greenhouse, conserving the soil in the best growing conditions, energy consumption of the system as a whole, climate control within the facility and pest control. The research is characterized by the being composed largely of ad hoc studies, which hinders the international collaboration between researchers and institutions.

Due to the requirements of more processing power for computations and predictions, the concept of Cloud-based smart agriculture is proposed for autonomic systems. This is where digital innovation and technology helps to improve the quality of life in the area of urbanization expansion. For the integration of cloud in smart agriculture, the system is shown to have security and privacy challenges, and most significantly, the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors, cloud, and base station (BS). The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications. The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes. In this article, we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters. The trust mechanism is an event-driven process that computes trust based on the pre-defined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree. The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches. We have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks.

Based on the field survey data of 433 farmers in Jianghan Plain, China, this paper estimate the impact of part-time farming on farmers’ adoption of CA technology by applying the multivariate logistic model. The results show that 91.92% of the farmers adopted CA technology. Part-time farming had a highly significant positive influence on the likelihood of adoption. Moreover, the impact degree increased along with the deepening of part-time farming. In addition, farmers’ adoption behaviors were affected by gender, contracted land area, economic welfare cognition and social welfare cognition. Our results help to understand farmers’ complex decision-making on farmland and to promote the sustainable development of agriculture in Jianghan Plain. A somewhat targeted approach to design policies to support technological, policy and institutional interventions to encourage farmers to engage in part-time farming are recommended, especially in areas that share similar edaphic and climatic characteristics with Jianghan Plain.

The Philippines is one of the world’s primary banana and pineapple producers. The input-intensive style of plantation agriculture for these typically exported crops has many adverse effects on the environment. While global studies have attempted to understand the biodiversity impacts of agricultural goods, there are few studies that have investigated the Philippines specifically. In this study, Philippine policies and data are investigated to better characterize the nexus between agriculture, biodiversity, and trade. An analysis of key national policies highlights that more stringent definitions and protections for biodiversity are needed to recognize the increasing roles that agricultural production, and importantly, its global trade, have on threatened Philippine species. A geographical analysis shows that many banana and pineapple plantations in Mindanao and their surrounding agricultural impact zones overlap with ecologically important areas, such as Protected Areas and Important Bird Areas. Overlaps of recorded species occurrence are observed within the immediate zones surrounding 250 plantations for banana and pineapple in Mindanao, with 83 threatened species of Philippine fauna and tree at risk of exposure to the impacts of intensive agriculture.

This results in stagnated crop productivity and declined farm profitability with increased emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, 3-year multi-location farmer’s participatory research trial was conducted to assess the impact of crop establishment and residue management techniques on crop productivity, economic profitability and environmental footprints in RWS. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of combinations of improved agronomic technologies compared to farmer’s practices (FP) on crop productivity, profitability, resource use efficiency and environmental footprints. The experiment had six scenarios that is, S1-Farmer’s practice; Conventional tillage (CT) without residue; S2-CT with residue, S3- Reduced tillage (RT) with residue + Recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF); S4-RT/zero tillage (ZT) with residue + RDF, S5-ZT with residue + RDF + green seeker + tensiometer + information & communication technology + crop insurance and S6- S5 + site specific nutrient management. Climate smart agriculture practices (CSAPs; mean of S4, S5 and S6) increase system productivity and farm profitability by 10.5% and 29.4% (on 3 yrs’ mean basis), whereas, improved farmers practices (mean of S2 and S3) resulted in only 3.2% and 5.3% increments compared to farmer’s practice (S1), respectively. On an average, CSAPs saved 39.3% of irrigation water and enhanced the irrigation and total water productivity by 53.9% and 18.4% than FP, respectively. In all the 3-years, CSAPs with high adaptive measures enhanced the energy-use-efficiency (EUE) and energy productivity (EP) by 43%–54% and 44%–61%, respectively than FP. In our study, global warming potential (GWP), GHG emission due to consumption energy and greenhouse gas intensity were recorded lower by 43%, 56% and 59% in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) with high adaptive measures than farmers practices (3652.7 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1, 722.2 kg CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1 and 718.7 Mg kg−1 CO2 eq. ha−1 yr−1). The findings of the present study revealed that CSA with adaption of innovative measures (S6) improved 3-year mean system productivity by 10.5%, profitability by 29.4%, water productivity and energy productivity by 18.3% and 48.9%, respectively than FP. Thus, the results of our 3-year farmer’s participatory study suggest that in a RW system, climate smart agriculture practices have better adaptive capacity and could be a feasible option for attaining higher yields, farm profitability, energy-use efficiency and water productivity with sustained/improved environmental quality in smallholder production systems of Eastern IGP of India and other similar agro-ecologies of South Asia. Finally, the adoption of these CSAPs should be promoted in the RW rotation of IGP to ensure food security, restoration of soil health and to mitigate climate change, the key sustainable development goals (SDGs).

The climate-smart agriculture initiative proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has attracted international attention. Smart agriculture (SA) has since been recognized as an influential trend contributing to agricultural development. Therefore, encouraging farmers to adopt digital technologies and mobile devices in farming practices has become a policy priority worldwide. However, the literature on the psychological factors driving farmers’ intentions to adopt SA technologies remains limited. This study investigated how farmers’ knowledge and attitudes regarding SA affect their adoption of smart technologies in Taiwan. A total of 321 farmers participated in a survey in 2017 and 2018, and the data were used to construct an ordinary least squares regression model of SA adoption. This study provides a preliminary understanding of the relationship between psychological factors and innovation adoption of SA technologies in a small-scale farming economic context. The findings suggest that policymakers and research and development institutes should concentrate on improving market access to established and critical SA technologies.

One of the ideas to overcome this problem is the eco-efficiency concept, analyzing the agricultural output in relation, not only to traditional inputs, but to the environmental impact, as well. This paper aims at calculating the eco-efficiency of Polish commercial farms, based on a representative sample of 601 farms participating in the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). To assess the eco-efficiency of the farms, variables illustrating traditional inputs (land, labor, capital), as well as variables reflecting the environmental pressure of the surveyed farms (greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nitrogen and phosphorus surpluses) were used. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) revealed that, on average, farms could reduce their inputs by almost a quarter without reducing their outputs. Additionally, it was revealed that incorporating externalities of agricultural production into analyses decreases the diversity of the farm population in terms of efficiency measures. According to the analyses, more eco-efficient farms are characterized by larger utilized agricultural area (UAA), higher production value, and higher intensity of chemical inputs per 1 ha, but at the same time by lower amounts of inputs used per production unit. Moreover, more eco-efficient farms achieved higher farm incomes in many terms: total, per 1 ha of UAA, and per 1 EUR of production value.

We measured agricultural carbon emissions in terms of five aspects: agricultural materials, rice planting, soil, livestock and poultry farming, and straw burning, and then compared the green total factor productivity index and the total factor productivity index. The study came to the following conclusions: (1) the green technology efficiency change was smaller than the technology efficiency change at first, but the gap between them is narrowing with time, such that the former is now larger than the latter; (2) the green technology efficiency was in a declining state and the green technology progress was increasing, promoting the green total factor productivity growth, from 1998 to 2016; and (3) China’s agricultural green total factor productivity increased by 4.2% annually in the east, 3.4% annually in the central region, and 2.5% annually in the west.

The surveys were carried out based on a synthetic technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS)-based measure. This method synthesizes factors of various nature and assigns them a synthetic aggregate measure. The analysis made it possible to develop a ranking of EU member states according to a differentiated level of measures and assign them to one of four groups characterized by different levels of sustainability in agriculture. The group of member states representing the highest level of sustainability in agriculture included two countries from Central and Eastern Europe, i.e., Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The group of countries with a greater than average level of sustainability comprised 14 member states of the European Union, including seven countries admitted to the community after 2004. The group with a low level of sustainability consisted of eight EU member states, six of them from the group of old EU member states, i.e., Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Italy, Denmark and the United Kingdom, and two new members, i.e., Romania and Slovenia. On the other hand, the lowest level of sustainability was characteristic of two “old EU” member states, i.e., The Netherlands and Belgium, and two “new EU” member states, i.e., Cyprus and Malta. The differentiated synthetic measure values showed disparities in the level of sustainability in agriculture among the member states of the European Union. They are a result of the varied level of development of this sector, production intensity and the resulting environmental impact.

The data collected through a survey of 559 green consumers were analyzed using explanatory factor analysis, the Relative Importance Index, and logistic regression. The results point out eleven main factors related to the offerings on the organic agriculture market that predominantly drive green consumers’ purchasing decisions. The Relative Importance Index identified health benefits that stem from a specific way of production as the main purchasing motive. This was also confirmed by the results of logistic regression, which showed that a respondent who buys organic agricultural products on a daily basis is approximately 71.5% less likely to disagree with the claim that organic products are healthier than non-organic, compared to a consumer who purchases organic products several times a week or month. However, as these benefits cannot be empirically confirmed, green consumers look for official labels on the product packaging. In order to assure the product quality, more than half of them find out very important information about producers: whether they have a product quality certificate (69.5%), how many years they are engaged in production (56.2%), and whether they have specific product packaging (54.9%). The Relative Importance Index also revealed that the main purchasing barriers that consumers face are scarce offerings and an insufficient development of the distribution channel, which were ranked in first and second place. The price as a barrier is of less importance. About 30.8% of the respondents are willing to pay up to 20% higher prices for organic food compared to conventional food, while 39.4% of them would pay even up to 40% higher prices. Based on the given results, there are clear suggestions for creating a sustainable marketing strategy for organic agriculture products as the main prerequisite for an increase of healthy food choices and fostering the future development of organic agriculture businesses at the local and global levels.

Many of these studies testify on the growing importance of ICT in influencing the evolution of the sector, especially by bringing down information barriers. While the potentialities of such technologies are widely investigated and confirmed, there is still a gap in understanding and modeling decisions on ICT information implementation. This gap concerns, in particular, accounting for all the aspects of uncertainty which are mainly due to a lack of knowledge on the reliability of ICT and on the errors of ICT-information. Overall, such uncertainties might affect Decision Makers’ (DM’s) behavior and hamper ICT uptake. To support policy makers in the designing of uncertainty-management policies for the achievement of the benefits of a digital irrigated agriculture, we further investigated the topic of uncertainty modelling in ICT uptake decisions. To do so, we reviewed the economic literature on ambiguity, in the context of the wider literature on decision making under uncertainty in order to explore its potential for better modeling ICT uptake decisions. Findings from the discussed literature confirm the capabilities of this approach to yield a deeper understanding of decision processes when the reliability of ICT is unknown and provides better insights on how behavioral barriers to the achievement of potential ICT-benefits can be overcome. Policy implications to accompany the sector in the digitalization process include mainly: (a) defining new approaches for ICT-developers to tailor platforms to answer heterogeneous DMs’ needs; (b) establish uncertainty-management policies complementary to DM tools adoption.

Games are also popular for non-experimental purposes such as recreating learning experiences and facilitating dialogue with local communities. After a systematic review of the literature, we found that the volume of published studies employing coordination and cooperation games increased during the 2000–2020 period. In recent years, more attention has been given to the areas of natural resource management, conservation, and ecology, particularly in regions important to agricultural sustainability. Other games, such as trust and risk games, have come to be regarded as standards of artefactual and framed field experiments in agriculture. Regardless of their scope, most games’ results are subject to criticism for their internal and external validity. In particular, a significant portion of the games reviewed here reveal recruitment biases towards women and provide few opportunities for continued impact assessment. However, games’ validity should be judged on a case-by-case basis. Specific cultural aspects of games might reflect the real context, and generalizing games’ conclusions to different settings is often constrained by cost and utility. Overall, games in agriculture could benefit from more significant, frequent, and inclusive experiments and data—all possibilities offered by digital technology. Present-day physical distance restrictions may accelerate this shift. New technologies and engaging mediums to approach farmers might present a turning point for integrating experimental and non-experimental games for agriculture in the 21st century.

However, the effects of such practices in soil under citrus orchards have not been well characterized. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of mowing and intercrop species on soil microbiological characteristics beneath a Tahiti acid lime orchard. The orchard was planted using minimum tillage and intercropped with two species of Urochloa species (U. ruziziensis—ruzi grass; U. decumbens—signal grass), with two types of mowers for Urochloa biomass (ecological; conventional) and herbicide applications. The study was conducted over 10 years. The ecological mower made the largest deposition of the intercrop biomass, thus providing the lowest disturbance of soil microbial activity and increasing, on average over all 10 years, the basal soil respiration (45%), microbial biomass carbon (25%), abundance of 16S rRNA (1.5%) and ITS (3.5%) genes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (30%), and providing a ca. 20% higher fruit yield. U. ruziziensis in combination with ecological mowing stimulated the abundance of the genes nifH (1.5%) and phoD (3.0%). The herbicide showed little influence. We conclude that the use of U. ruziziensis as an intercrop in citrus orchards subjected to ecological mowing can be recommended for improving and sustaining soil quality and citrus fruit production.

The pressure of urbanization has led to a mismatch between production and consumption in space and pattern. The current status and trends in urban food system planning illustrated that sustainable consumption and production were closely related to their spatial layout. The paper took a simulated sustainable food system in urban community as an example. It formulated a rational spatial planning strategy based on urban agriculture of different scales, technologies, and efficiencies, quantified productive community metrics to accommodate different scales of urban space, and wrote algorithms to develop a spatial model of a meta-cellular automaton that coupled consumer housing with productive surfaces. Finally, by comparing and optimizing the spatial patterns of multiple solutions, urban agriculture-oriented urban community planning was developed. The model was only a preliminary attempt at food system planning, but it explored the distribution patterns of housing and agriculture within a given territory in three steps: theoretical strategy-morphological simulation-planning design while meeting urban and productivity indicators. It demonstrated the feasibility of productive spaces and explored a planning strategy for urban communities that supports sustainable consumption and production.

However, global problems with the environment, increasing pollution, and gas heating emissions have made environmental issues a major priority. Suddenly, human beings have realized that environmental investments are needed to maintain better world conditions for future generations. This article investigates the development of agricultural investment in the context of production factors in Polish voivodeships in the years 2000–2018. Farmers have to choose between investing and developing production or being more environmentally friendly and invest on a smaller scale or transform their farms into organic production. Moreover, the investment in environmental protection in Poland was analyzed. Investment outlays on fixed assets for environmental protection and outlays on fixed assets for water management were investigated. The level of investment has changed since Poland joined the EU. With membership, Poland gained access to new markets and technology. Particular attention has been focused on production factors (land, capital, and the work force). We have conducted as a proxy regular regression analysis and after panel regression to measure the impact of the chosen factors on explained variables: investment outlays in agriculture, and investment outlays per 1 ha of agricultural land. We have used correlation analysis to examine the relations between explanatory variables and total gross investment in agriculture and total investment outlays in agriculture per 1 ha of agricultural land, outlays on fixed assets for environmental protection, and outlays on fixed assets for water management. Our analysis confirms that explanatory variables are important in shaping total investment outlays in agriculture and total investment outlays per 1 ha of agricultural land.

Initiatives to promote pro-health dietary behaviour are possibly being compromised by poor or inconsistent consumer accessibility to affordable and safe fresh fruits and vegetables, referred to as the agriculture–nutrition–income nexus. While donors increasingly focus on nutrition-sensitive agriculture across the Pacific, there is little contemporary information concerning Tonga’s domestic horticultural distribution and market system, particularly in regards to food loss. This study surveyed 292 municipal and road-side vendors on Tongatapu and ‘Utu Vava’u Islands, with the aim of mapping and analyzing horticultural markets and farm supply, transport logistics, and quantifying postharvest practice and market loss. Tonga’s domestic horticultural market structure consists of a central municipal market and on Tongatapu Island, a supplementary network of urban and rural based road-side vendors. There is limited inter-island trade, with most farms located within 25 km of the central municipal market. Mean postharvest horticultural loss was very low, at 1.4% to 5.3%, with road-side vendors more vulnerable to loss. This level of loss was thought to reflect short intra-island transport distance, the type of crops being traded, and rapid market throughput, rather than a level of value chain efficiency. Vendors regulated market supply volume and price discounting and were the principal strategies to mitigate postharvest loss. While low levels of postharvest loss, short transport logistics, and fast market throughput are consistent with a relatively efficient horticulture market system, vendor practice may be impeding fresh fruit and vegetable accessibility.

In order to implement these systems, it is necessary to replace the traditional model of “extract-use-consume-dispose” with a model based on the principles of the Circular Economy (CE), optimizing the use of resources and minimizing the generation of waste. Almería has become a paradigm of this type of high-yield agricultural system, with the largest concentration of greenhouses in the world. This study analyses the opportunities that the CE can offer the intensive agriculture sector in Almería in order to obtain long-term sustainability. The results show a wide variety of alternatives, both on an agricultural exploitation level and in the case of the product packaging and wholesale centers. The priority areas of action are waste management, the prevention of product waste and the improvement in the efficiency of the use of water and energy.

Making agriculture sustainable has become so essential that it has become part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). However, producers ultimately decide individually the practices they implement. This is why farmers play a central role in ensuring a sustainable agricultural system, which results from farmers’ knowledge and expectations. Although numerous studies address sustainability issues, little is known about farmers’ knowledge and implementation of sustainable practices at different types of farms, especially in central and eastern Europe. This study aimed to determine Polish farmers’ awareness of sustainability with regards to animal and crop production. This paper also shows how farmers value the advantages arising from sustainable production. The study was carried out among 300 farms classified by type (dairy, beef cattle, pork, and crop production). The research instrument used was a questionnaire, with the Likert scale. The results show that dairy farmers and pork farmers declared higher knowledge and better implement sustainable practices than other farmers. The producers’ views on the benefits coming from sustainable agriculture varied. However, the two most significant advantages were recognized—the protection of water against pollution and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

They were published between 1994 and 2011. Many are authored by West European and North American experts. The most-cited articles are attributed to three major themes and eight particular topics, and the best-explored topic is the influence of climate change on agriculture. Moreover, they provide some essential information about the strong relation of both agriculture and climate change to energy transition. The general frame characterizing complex interactions of climate change and agriculture development is proposed on the basis of the most-cited works, but it needs further detail, improvement, and update. The considered articles are basic sources with historical importance.

These systems may have the potential to provide rural electrification and encourage rural development, as PV panels are now becoming more financially attractive due to their falling costs. The implementation of solar PV systems in such areas improves social and communal services, water supply and agriculture, as well as other productive activities. It may also convert these communities into more environmentally sustainable ones. The present paper details two case studies from Palestine and shows the inter-relation between energy, water and food in rural areas to demonstrate how the availability of sustainable energy can ensure water availability, improve agricultural productivity and increase food security. Further, the paper attempts to evaluate the technical and economic impacts of the application of nexus approaches to Palestine’s rural areas. The results of this study are for a real implemented project and predict the long-term success of small, sustainable energy projects in developing rural areas in Palestine.

Climate change in Romania is part of the global context, taking into account the regional conditions, with an increasing trend of arid summer. While the link between high temperatures, climate change and rainfall has been modeled in detail, the situation is not the same for plant water accessibility. The period of time between 1898 and the present, corresponding to the annual records of precipitation and evapotranspiration, overlapped with important political and administrative changes in the studied area, and with extensive hydro-amelioration works. The aim of the paper is to statistically follow the evolution over time of precipitation, namely of evapotranspiration measured in Western Romania, which would allow the expression of conclusions regarding the improvement directions of the water regime. In order to follow the evolution in time of these data, the interval of 1898–2019 was divided into three periods: 1898–1950, 1951–1989 and 1990–2019, respectively. The increase in temperature, especially during the vegetation period and the large number of years in which evapotranspiration quantitatively exceeds the precipitation, indicating the need for effective measures to regulate the water balance.

Microbial (arbuscular mycorrhizal and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria: Azotobacter, Azospirillum and Rizhobium spp.) and non-microbial (humic substances, silicon, animal- and vegetal-based protein hydrolysate and macro- and micro-algal extracts) biostimulants represent a sustainable and effective alternative or complement for their synthetic counterparts, bringing benefits to the environment, biodiversity, human health and economy. The Special Issue “Toward a sustainable agriculture through plant biostimulants: from experimental data to practical applications” compiles 34 original research articles, 4 review papers and 1 brief report covering the implications of microbial and non-microbial biostimulants for improving seedling growth and crop performance, nutrient use efficiency and quality of the produce as well as enhancing the tolerance/resistance to a wide range of abiotic stresses in particular salinity, drought, nutrient deficiency and high temperature. The present compilation of high standard scientific papers on principles and practices of plant biostimulants will foster knowledge transfer among researchers, fertilizer and biostimulant industries, stakeholders, extension specialists and farmers, and it will enable a better understanding of the physiological and molecular mechanisms and application procedure of biostimulants in different cropping systems.

However, agriculture green technology diffusion is indeed a challenging task and still faces numerous barriers. The stakeholders who can potentially deal with these barriers, however, have been overlooked by previous studies. To address these issues, social network analysis was performed to identify critical stakeholders and barriers. Their interactions in agriculture green technology diffusion were analyzed based on the literature, a questionnaire survey and expert judgments. A two-mode network and two one-mode networks were used to analyze the relationships among the identified 12 barriers and 14 stakeholders who can influence these 12 barriers identified. The results show that agricultural research institutes, universities, agribusiness, agencies of township promotion, the government and farmers’ relatives are key stakeholders and that the limited market demand for green technology and the high cost of its diffusion are two main barriers. However, poor green technology operability and farmer families in distress are factors that are not as important as previously perceived.

To utilize a minimum amount of inputs and complete the task without a revisit, one needs to employ optimized routes and optimal points of delivering the inputs required in precision agriculture (PA). First, stressed regions are identified using VegNet (Vegetative Network) software. Then, methods are applied for obtaining optimal routes and points for the spraying of inputs with an autonomous UAV for PA. This paper reports a unique and innovative technique to calculate the optimum location of spray points required for a particular stressed region. In this technique, the stressed regions are divided into many circular divisions with its center being a spray point of the stressed region. These circular divisions would ensure a more effective dispersion of the spray. Then an optimal path is found out which connects all the stressed regions and their spray points. The paper also describes the use of methods and algorithms including travelling salesman problem (TSP)-based route planning and a Voronoi diagram which allows applying precision agriculture techniques.

This tool combines two methods—system dynamics (SD) and temporal soil carbon modelling. The case study for sustainability analysis of Danish agriculture and green biorefineries supply chains in Denmark is used. The development of the Danish agriculture sector is simulated and assessed in relation to the ecosystem’s carrying capacity until 2050, defined as 1.4 livestock units per hectare. The results show that under the current development, the agriculture sector would exceed this carrying capacity shortly after 2030. The results obtained from the dynamic sustainability assessment tool show a more precise and less optimistic projection of future development than the assessment using constant soil carbon modelling values only. The study, therefore, suggests that the use of the temporal aspects in the sustainability assessment should be included and further developed.

The village is developed through community empowerment and the utilization of existing tourism resources. In this study, tourists to the village were selected to participate in a survey. The findings indicated that country landscape resources scored the highest, followed by experience of organic farming and natural landscape resources. The results revealed that this travel destination enjoys high brand equity, with the factor of environmental sustainability scoring the highest, followed by the uniqueness of organic farming and the image of healthy tourism. This study suggested that landscape resources were positively correlated with brand equity; moreover, access to environmental information had a significant effect on the relationship between landscape resources and brand equity. Subsequently, the top three factors affecting landscape resources were identified—natural landscape resources, experience of organic farming, and experience of farm stays. In addition, the two factors influencing brand equity of quality and unique resources were derived. This study’s results can help related organizations effectively establish landscape resources, thereby extending their brand equity and building the sustainable development competitiveness of tourist destinations.

Managing natural resources and mainstreaming biodiversity across agriculture sectors are keys towards a sustainable agriculture focused on resource efficiency. Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) is considered the main driving force of water movements in the plant vascular system, however the tools available to monitor this parameter are usually based on environmental monitoring. The driving motif of this paper is the development of an in-vivo sensor to monitor the effects of VPD changes in the plant. We have used an in vivo sensor, termed “bioristor”, to continuously monitor the changes occurring in the sap ion’s status when plants experience different VPD conditions and we observed a specific R (sensor response) trend in response to VPD. The possibility to directly monitor the physiological changes occurring in the plant in different VPD conditions, can be used to increase efficiency of the water management in controlled conditions thus achieving a more sustainable use of natural resources.

Price risks, which are generally not insurable per se, have been covered by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which has been shaped as a system of protection against market shocks and an instrument for income stabilization. However, there is an increasing propensity to combine the use of public and private risk management tools as well. In Spain, revenue insurance has not yet developed in the same way as other risk coverage insurance, although it is an upcoming target of agricultural insurance policies with the aim of ensuring income stability for agricultural producers. This paper presents the results of the methodology used to draw up a composition index or model of the average price for the season or representative market field price to be used for revenue insurance purposes in citrus fruit. High explanatory power regression models and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were used. The results show that the average price for the season obtained reliably represents the market field prices in the country’s various producer areas.

The results showed that soil bulk density (BD) was significantly higher in cropland plots compared to the vineyard and olive orchard. No differences were observed in soil water content (SWC) and mean weight diameter (MWD). Water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic matter (SOM), and total nitrogen (TN) were significantly higher in the olive orchard compared to the other land uses. In cropland, during the experiment, we did not identify runoff or soil losses. Runoff (Run) and sediment loss (SL) were significantly higher in the olive orchard compared to the other plots. This was very likely a consequence of tillage practices in vertic soils, the use of herbicides, low vegetation cover, as well as the incorporation of hydrophobic organic matter in the soil matrix. The principal component analysis results showed that factor 1 explained the majority of the runoff and erosion variables. Erosion rates and nutrient losses were substantially different between olive orchard plots, and vineyard and cropland. Factor 2 showed that WSA was inversely related to the available phosphorus, water holding capacity, and sediment concentration. Management practices in the studied area should use minimum tilling frequency to have plant cover and avoid erosion.

The spatial representation of these agricultural data through yield and fruit quality maps allows for crop management in a precise way that means that agricultural operations may be carried out considering intraorchard variability, thus resulting in greater efficiency. The aim of this work was to advance the development of new tools for the generation of yield and quality maps for precision agriculture. A new tool was implemented for citrus through a dashboard called CitrusYield that integrates the requirements demanded by technicians and farmers in terms of spatial distribution and the quality of their citrus production. The data for testing were collected by a prototype of a citrus harvest-assist platform. In order to obtain maps showing heterogeneity of production, an experimental plot with different varieties and variable production was chosen. The maps, tables and graphs showing different crop data were generated automatically by CitrusYield from the analysis of the data collected. The main advantage of knowing the differences in production between the swaths and areas inside the crop is to provide the grower with precise information to make accurate decisions for localised crop management, such as fertilisation, irrigation, pest and disease control, etc. View Full-Text',\n"," 'Combining agriculture with behaviour change communication and other nutrition-sensitive interventions could improve feeding practices to reduce maternal and child undernutrition. Such integrated intervention requires rigorous design and an appropriate implementation strategy to generate an impact. We assessed feasibility and acceptability of an intervention package that combines nutrition counselling, counselling and support for home-gardening, and unconditional cash transfers delivered to women on a mobile platform for improving maternal and child nutrition behaviours among low-income families in rural Bangladesh. We used mixed-methods including in-depth interviews with women (20), key-informant interviews with project workers (6), and a cross sectional survey of women (60). Women well-accepted the intervention and reported to be benefited by acquiring new skills and information on home gardening and nutrition. They established homestead gardens of seasonal vegetables successfully and were able to find a solution for major challenges. All women received the cash transfer. Ninety-one percent of women spent the cash for buying foods, 20% spent it on purchasing seeds or fertilizers and 57% used it for medical and livelihood purchases. Project staff and mobile banking agent reported no difficulty in cash transfer. Combining nutrition-specific and -sensitive interventions is a feasible and acceptable approach.

An experiment initiated in 1997 to evaluate the level of tillage and the amount of soil cover needed for conservation agriculture to work under irrigated conditions in the highlands of San Luis Potosí, Mexico. The trial encompassed seven treatments: conventional tillage, two types of reduced tillage and permanent raised beds (PB), which are untilled, with four levels of soil cover in an irrigated rotation with maize (Zea mays L.) in the summer and fodder oats (Avena sativa L.) in the winter. Maize and oats yielded significantly more under PB than with tillage. Maize yielded on average 1.2 Mg ha−1 more in PB with the hybrid used from 1997 to 2008 and 3.9 Mg ha−1 more with the hybrid used from 2012 to 2017. Permanent raised beds generated on average $18,424 MXN ha−1 more profit than the tilled treatments and increased soil organic carbon on average 63% at 0 to 5 cm depth and 32% at 5 to 30 cm depth. The trial shows that conservation agriculture, with PB and little residue cover, is a viable and sustainable option in similar production systems.

In this three-year field experiment, we tested the performances of an innovative vegetable organic and conservative system (ORG+) combining the use of cover crops (exploited as either living or dead mulch) and no-till techniques. This system was compared to “business-as-usual” organic farming (ORG) and integrated farming system (INT) based on the same crop sequence: savoy cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. sabauda L. cv. Famosa), spring lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Justine), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. Cv. Montebianco), and summer lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Ballerina RZ). The results of crop yield parameters and weed abundance contribute to spotlight potentialities and weaknesses of organic-conservative management of field vegetables. In particular, ORG+ caused significant yield depletion for all the crops and revealed suboptimal weed control and N availability. The agroecosystem services provided by the cover crops grown in the ORG+ as dead mulch or living mulch were affected by weather conditions and not always resulted in significant crop gain. Nevertheless, interesting results in terms of P availability and reduced N surplus encourage further development of the system targeting more sustainable organic vegetable production.

Consequently, soil-based decisions are often made using a data limiting approach, as the value proposition of soil data collection has not been well described. The work presented here investigates the spatial errors of gypsum and lime recommendations based on industry-standard blanket-rate and zone-based variable rate application, as well as the more advanced pedometric approaches – ordinary kriging (OK) and regression kriging (RK). All methods were tested at sampling densities between 0.1–3 samples/ha for a 108 ha broadacre site in central NSW, Australia. Whilst previous work has tested the effect of sampling density on the spatial predictive performance of OK and RK, here we assess prediction accuracy as the error associated with soil management decisions based on their results (i.e., the over- and under-application error of gypsum and lime applications) in conjunction with the RMSE of prediction for soil pH and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The uncertainty of each method is also tested to observe the effect of random initialisation on predictive performance. Results indicated that RK provided superior spatial predictions across all sampling densities for the application of gypsum and lime, with a blanket-rate application providing the worse results, with over- and under-application errors exceeding 200 t and 300 t respectively for 40–60 cm treatment for the entire field. Interestingly, the spatial accuracy of amendment application increased to a sampling density of 0.5 samples/ha for RK, with minimal improvement thereafter, suggesting that meaningful soil amelioration advice can be attained proximal to this density.

However, CSA is a somewhat challenging concept in Taiwan because many CSA projects face difficulties and obstacles related to sustainability, so relevant literature is rare. This pilot study investigates a potential CSA program in a farmers’ market to observe whether farmers’ market consumers would like to participate or not. A total of 320 survey responses collected from a farmers’ market were examined by an interval regression model. Results show that respondents are willing to pay and to be a CSA member of the farmers’ market. This study identifies that consumers are willing to share the risks of upfront payment with farmers. The preferred length of the contract means that a compromise is made in order to implement the CSA program. The implications involving a flexible length of contract and the budget should be taken into consideration by farmers, farmers’ market managers, and policymakers for devising promotion strategies, enrolling shareholders, and promoting CSA in Taiwan. Future study should focus on the consumer characteristics and factors affecting their decision to subscribe to CSA.

Usually, these sensor nodes (SNs) alternate their states between periods of activation and hibernation to reduce battery usage. When employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from SNs distributed over a large agricultural area, we must synchronize the UAV route with the activation period of each SN. In this article, we address the problem of optimizing the UAV path through all the SNs to reduce its flight time, while also maximizing the SNs’ lifetime. Using the concept of timeslots for time base management combined with the idea of flight prohibition list, we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering and reconfiguring the activation time of the SNs. Experimental results were obtained through the development of our own simulator—UAV Simulator. These results demonstrate a considerable reduction in the distance traveled by the UAV and also in its flight time. In addition, the model provides a reduction in transmission time by SNs after reconfiguration, thus ensuring a longer lifetime for the SNs in the monitoring environment, as well as improving the freshness and continuity of the gathered data, which support the decision-making process.

The rapid development of engineered biochar produced using different feedstock materials via various methods for wastewater treatment in recent years urges an up-to-date review on this topic. This article centers on summarizing state-of-the-art methods for engineered biochar production and discussing the multidimensional benefits of applying biochar for water reuse and soil amendment in a closed-loop agriculture system. Based on numerous recent articles (<5 years) published in journals indexed in the Web of Science, engineered biochar’s production methods, modification techniques, physicochemical properties, and performance in removing inorganic, organic, and emerging contaminants from wastewater are reviewed in this study. It is concluded that biochar-based technologies have great potential to be used for treating both point-source and diffuse-source wastewater in agricultural systems, thus decreasing water demand while improving crop yields. As biochar can be produced using crop residues and other biomass wastes, its on-farm production and subsequent applications in a closed-loop agriculture system will not only eliminate expensive transportation costs, but also create a circular flow of materials and energy that promotes additional environmental and economic benefits.

A healthy community includes four aspects of health, namely, healthy production, healthy lifestyle, healthy environment and ecosystem, and healthy physical and mental states of residents living in the community. Urban agriculture (UA), as a form of the community garden, is a supplementary form for the lack of production function in the urban community. It also has the potential to contribute to sustainable and resilient urban communities. This study focuses on analysing the health benefits of UA and attempts to identify old community residents’ attitudes and perceptions towards UA and understand their confusion and worry. The purpose of this study is to promote the healthy and sustainable development of old communities by integrating UA into the micro-transformation of old communities and provide planning and design strategies and community development ideas for the micro-transformation. Surveys were conducted on 10 old communities in Yuexiu district, located in Guangzhou, China. Statistical analysis was conducted using IBM Statistical SPSS version 26 to obtain information on the factor structure of residents’ perceptions towards the health benefits of UA. The analysis results showed significant differences between gender groups and the status of children on old community residents’ perceptions towards general UA benefits. The main factors accounting for old community residents’ perceptions towards the health benefits of UA were environmental health benefits, physical and psychological health benefits, and community health benefits. When developing UA in old communities, co-construction and co-sharing mode, public participation mode, and promotion mode are three important development strategies. Construction location, design style, and seasonal design are also critical for the construction of UA in old communities.

Precision Agriculture (PA) is one of the focuses of these policies to optimize the crops and facilitate crop management using technology. Drones have been gaining popularity in PA to perform remote sensing activities such as photo and video capture as well as other activities such as fertilization or scaring animals. These drones could be used as a mobile gateway as well, benefiting from its already designed flight plan. In this paper, we evaluate the adequacy of remote sensing drones to perform gateway functionalities, providing a guide for choosing the best drone parameters for successful WiFi data transmission between sensor nodes and the gateway in PA systems for crop monitoring and management. The novelty of this paper compared with existing mobile gateway proposals is that we are going to test the performance of the drone that is acting as a remote sensing tool to carry a low-cost gateway node to gather the data from the nodes deployed on the field. Taking this in mind, simulations of different scenarios were performed to determine if the data can be transmitted correctly or not considering different flying parameters such as speed (from 1 to 20 m/s) and flying height (from 4 to 104 m) and wireless sensor network parameters such as node density (1 node each 60 m2 to 1 node each 5000 m2) and antenna coverage (25 to 200 m). We have calculated the time that each node remains with connectivity and the time required to send the data to estimate if the connection will be bad, good, or optimal. Results point out that for the maximum node density, there is only one combination that offers good connectivity (lowest velocity, the flying height of 24 m, and antenna with 25 m of coverage). For the other node densities, several combinations of flying height and antenna coverage allows good and optimal connectivity.

The purpose was to help relevant agencies use aerial imaging in managing agricultural production. This study involves five townships in the Chianan Plain of Chiayi County, Taiwan. About 100 ha of farmland in each township was selected as a sample area, and a quadcopter and a handheld fixed-wing drone were used to capture visible-light images and multispectral images. The survey was carried out from August to October 2018 and aerial photographs were captured in clear and dry weather. This study used high-resolution images captured from a UAV to classify the uses of agricultural land, and then employed information from multispectral images and elevation data from a digital surface model. The results revealed that visible-light images led to low interpretation accuracy. However, multispectral images and elevation data increased the accuracy rate to nearly 90%.

A randomized complete block design in a split-split-plot arrangement was used to evaluate the short-term (2012–2015) effects of tillage (no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT)), rotation (maize-fallow-maize (MFM); maize-fallow-soybean (MFS); maize-wheat-maize (MWM) and maize-wheat-soybean (MWS)) and residue management (residue removal (R−) and residue retention (R+)) on bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), soil hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and macroporosity hydraulic conductivity. The interaction of tillage × crop rotation × residue management was not significant (p > 0.05) with respect to BD, PR, Ks and macroporosity. The MFM rotation had the highest BD (1.40 g cm−3), followed by MWM rotation (1.36 g cm−3), and the least BD was observed in the MFS rotation (1.29 g cm−3). Penetration resistance was significantly higher in CT (2.43 MPa) compared to NT (1.46 MPa). The study concludes that inclusion of MFS and MWS rotations can potentially reduce BD in the short term.

Conservation agriculture (CA) has been regarded as an ideal field management strategy to profoundly benefit water use and therefore crop production. However, it remains unclear as to how crop production and water use respond to annual precipitation and how CA practices affect crop production through regulating water use. In this study, a meta-analysis based on field observations was conducted to investigate the relationship between water use and crop production. The results showed that annual precipitation of 300 mm yr−1 is a threshold to ensure relatively high crop production and water use efficiency (WUE), and 600 mm yr−1 is the most favorable rainfall level for crop production and WUE. Evapotranspiration (ET) was linearly related to annual precipitation, except that it was not the lowest when annual rainfall <300 mm yr−1. Although straw mulching is more important than tillage reduction, tillage reduction is still necessary to combine with straw mulching to obtain a higher production of crop. Crop production, ET, and WUE kept increasing as experimental duration increased, indicating that extending CA term is essential to further improve water use and crop production. We further proposed mathematical equations to prove that the increase in transpiration plays a critical role in water use and crop production improvement. WUE is not necessarily related to the increase in yield, and, therefore, higher transpiration rather than increased WUE should be the target for crop production improvement. The results also suggest that evaporation and transpiration are not presented separately, which limits investigation of the effective use of water by identifying transpiration. Overall, annual precipitation is essential for the levels of crop production, ET, and WUE on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Reasonable CA practices, especially long-term application, could improve water use and crop production through increasing transpiration. However, a better future understanding of the relationship between crop production and water use needs more detailed information about the effective use of water at field scales.

This important abiotic stress has worsened in the last 20 years due to the increase in water demands in arid and semi-arid areas. In this context, increasing tolerance of crop plants to salt stress is needed to guarantee future food supply to a growing population. This review compiles knowledge on the use of phytoprotectants of microbial origin (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria), osmoprotectants, melatonin, phytohormones and antioxidant metabolism-related compounds as alleviators of salt stress in numerous plant species. Phytoprotectants are discussed in detail, including their nature, applicability, and role in the plant in terms of physiological and phenotype effects. As a result, increased crop yield and crop quality can be achieved, which in turn positively impact food security.

Naturally-occurring rocks and minerals may help address these challenges. In this case, we explore opportunities through which the geosphere could support viable agricultural systems, primarily via a literature review supplemented by data analysis and preliminary-scale experimentation. Our objective is to focus on opportunities specifically relating to emerging agricultural challenges. Our findings reveal that a spectrum of common geological materials can assist across four key agricultural challenges: 1. Providing environmentally-sustainable fertiliser deposits especially for the two key elements in food production, nitrogen (via use of slow release N-rich clays), and phosphorus (via recovery of the biomineral struvite) as well as through development of formulations to tap into mineral nutrient reserves underlying croplands. 2. Reducing contamination from farms—using clays, zeolites, and hydroxides to intercept, and potentially recycle nutrients discharged from paddocks. 3. Embedding drought resilience into agricultural landscapes by increasing soil moisture retention (using high surface area minerals including zeolite and smectite), boosting plant availability of drought protective elements (using basalts, smectites, and zeolites), and decreasing soil surface temperature (using reflective smectites, zeolites, and pumices), and 4. mitigating emissions of all three major greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide (using fast-weathering basalts), methane (using iron oxides), and nitrous oxide (using nitrogen-sorbing clays). Drawbacks of increased geological inputs into agricultural systems include an increased mining footprint, potential increased loads of suspended sediments in high-rainfall catchments, changes to geo-ecological balances, and possible harmful health effects to practitioners extracting and land-applying the geological materials.

Although all three components of conservation agriculture (minimal tillage, permanent soil cover and crop diversification) can reduce weed populations, these effects may only become apparent in the medium to long term. This study evaluated weed biomass, density and diversity with and without herbicide control in a long-term trial initiated in 1991 in the Mexican Highlands to evaluate all three components of conservation agriculture. Data were collected in 2004, 2005, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Weed density and biomass were generally lower in conservation agriculture than with conventional tillage. The three components of conservation agriculture significantly reduced weed biomass, which was lower when all three components were applied together. When herbicides were applied, weed biomass in conservation agriculture was 91% lower in maize and 81% lower in wheat than in conventional tillage. Different treatments favored different weed species, but no trend toward increased perennial weeds was observed in conservation agriculture. These data supported claims stating that if adequate weed control is achieved in the initial years, weed populations in conservation agriculture systems are lower than in conventional tillage systems.

Finally, we review the scientific literature on plant development, specifically searching for any direct or indirect reference to the influence of the Moon on plant physiology. We found that there is no reliable, science-based evidence for any relationship between lunar phases and plant physiology in any plant–science related textbooks or peer-reviewed journal articles justifying agricultural practices conditioned by the Moon. Nor does evidence from the field of physics support a causal relationship between lunar forces and plant responses. Therefore, popular agricultural practices that are tied to lunar phases have no scientific backing. We strongly encourage teachers involved in plant sciences education to objectively address pseudo-scientific ideas and promote critical thinking.

However, humans possess five basic perceptual systems with accuracy levels that can change from human to human which are largely dependent on the stress, experience, health and age. To overcome this problem, in the last decade, with the help of the emergence of smartphone technology, new agronomic applications were developed to reach better, cost-effective, more accurate and portable diagnosis systems. Conventional smartphones are equipped with several sensors that could be useful to support near real-time usual and advanced farming activities at a very low cost. Therefore, the development of agricultural applications based on smartphone devices has increased exponentially in the last years. However, the great potential offered by smartphone applications is still yet to be fully realized. Thus, this paper presents a literature review and an analysis of the characteristics of several mobile applications for use in smart/precision agriculture available on the market or developed at research level. This will contribute to provide to farmers an overview of the applications type that exist, what features they provide and a comparison between them. Also, this paper is an important resource to help researchers and applications developers to understand the limitations of existing tools and where new contributions can be performed.

To highlight the weed management practices used by farmers in conservation agriculture and the changes induced by its adoption, a large sample of 425 French farmers were invited to complete an online survey. Weed management practices used by farmers were requested for three periods: before adoption, during the first years of conservation agriculture (one to two years after adoption), and when the agricultural system is considered “mastered” by the farmer. The use of each farming practice was firstly studied independently for each period. Then, a multiple correspondence analysis followed by a hierarchical ascendant classification resulted in groups of farmers with different combinations of practices for each period. Finally, the groups of farmers were followed through the periods. Results showed that changes in weed management done according to farmers when adopting and mastering conservation agriculture are multiple and vary according to farmers and their previous weed management. Although some similar choices were identified, some farmers’ trajectories, especially those with a prior combination driven by either a soil disturbance strategy or a crop competitiveness strategy, are difficult to identify when adopting conservation agriculture. Upon mastering the agricultural system, farmers’ choices become more apparent. View Full-Text',\n"," 'Approximately 6.5% of the world’s arable and marginal soils are either saline or sodic. The situation will worsen due to climate change. Regardless of the cause that generated the salinity, i.e., whether primary or secondary, the effect of soil salinization on plant growth and on living organisms will be severe. To mitigate such impacts, several studies have been carried out over the years with the aim of providing technical or management solutions to deal with the multiple consequences of soil salinity. A review by Cuevas et al. proposes a new approach looking for solutions through soil-improving cropping systems (SICSs). The SICSs have to prevent, mitigate or remediate the negative impacts of soil salinization. The efforts of Cuevas et al. were to organize the analyses by focusing on SICSs that would: (1) prevent or halt secondary salinization; (2) cope with salinization; (3) reverse salinization. The study is concluded by an effort to assess the impacts of each SICS and of the combined SICSs application in terms of agronomic, economic, and environmental aspects. Both economic constraints and the collective willingness of stakeholders to innovate are taken into in the evaluation of feasibility. It is important to put into practice and/or identify a number of sustainable actions, at low environmental input, to improve crop tolerance to water deficit and high salinity as well as to preserve biodiversity and mitigate the impact of climate changes. At the same time, these actions would ensure crop productivity in the area, thus guaranteeing environment and social benefits to the local population, and thus weakening the motivation to abandon the land. The aim of this editorial is to propose a broader perspective on the review by Cuevas et al. “A Review of Soil-Improving Cropping Systems for Soil Salinization”. In the review, the authors go through several soil-improving cropping systems (SICSs) by considering them separately or in combination with the aim to provide guidelines towards resolving, counteracting or mitigating soil salinity. I tried to highlight the strengths of the study by Cuevas et al., while suggesting related topics that may deserve further attention by the community.

For the reduction of ammonia emissions, different management steps have been reported in most EU countries. Some authors, however, have criticized such individual measures, because attempts to abate the emission of ammonia may lead to significant increases in either methane, nitrous oxide, or carbon dioxide. In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of experimental European data published in peer-reviewed journals to evaluate the impact of major agricultural management practices on ammonia emissions, including the pollution swapping effect. The result of our meta-analysis showed that for the treatment, storage, and application stages, only slurry acidification was effective for the reduction of ammonia emissions (−69%), and had no pollution swapping effect with other greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide (−21%), methane (−86%), and carbon dioxide (−15%). All other management strategies, like biological treatment, separation strategies, different storage types, the concealing of the liquid slurry with different materials, and variable field applications were effective to varying degrees for the abatement of ammonia emission, but also resulted in the increased emission of at least one other greenhouse gas. The strategies focusing on the decrease of ammonia emissions neglected the consequences of the emissions of other greenhouse gases. We recommend a combination of treatment technologies, like acidification and soil incorporation, and/or embracing emerging technologies, such as microbial inhibitors and slow release fertilizers.

However, scaling limitations exist at the regional level due to big data volumes and processing constraints. Here, we demonstrate the Fusion Approach for Remotely-Sensed Mapping of Agriculture (FARMA), using a suite of open source software capable of efficiently characterizing time-series field-scale statistics across large geographical areas at VHR resolution. We provide distinct implementation examples in Vietnam and Senegal to demonstrate the approach using WorldView VHR optical, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, and Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 optical imagery. This distributed software is open source and entirely scalable, enabling large area mapping even with modest computing power. FARMA provides the ability to extract and monitor sub-hectare fields with multisensor raster signals, which previously could only be achieved at scale with large computational resources. Implementing FARMA could enhance predictive yield models by delineating boundaries and tracking productivity of smallholder fields, enabling more precise food security observations in low and lower-middle income countries.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the overall efficiency of a vertical subsurface flow system (VSSFs) constructed wetland (CW) operating for the treatment of first-flush stormwater and the effects of treated wastewater on the morphological and aesthetic characteristics of ornamental pepper and rosemary plants. The system had a total surface area of 46.80 m2 and was planted with common reed and giant reed. Wastewater samples were taken from October 2018 to July 2019 at the CW inlet and outlet for chemical-physical and microbiological characterization of the wastewater. Two separate experimental fields of rosemary and ornamental pepper were set up in another Sicilian location. Three sources of irrigation water, two accessions of rosemary and two varieties of ornamental pepper were tested in a split-plot design for a two-factor experiment. The results showed very high organic pollutant removal (BOD5 75–83%, COD 65–69%) and a good efficiency of nutrients (TN 60–66%) and trace metals (especially for Cu and Zn) removal. Escherichia coli concentration levels were always lower than 100 CFU 100 mL−1 during the test period. Irrigation water and plant habitus had significant effects on all the morphological and aesthetic characteristics of the plants. For both the crops, plants irrigated with freshwater and treated wastewater had greater growth and showed a better general appearance in comparison with plants irrigated with wastewater. The higher trace metal levels in the wastewater produced adverse effects on plant growth and reduced the visual quality of the plants. Our results suggest the suitability of a VSSFs constructed wetland for the treatment of first-flush stormwater and the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation purposes, in accordance with legislation requirements concerning wastewater quality.

Hence, it is essential to address the question of “how to improve China’s agricultural productivity and efficiency in order to achieve growth and sustainability of agriculture in the future”. This paper estimates indices of China’s agricultural technical efficiency (TE) scores, total-factor productivity (TFP), and its two components, technological change/progress (TC) and technical efficiency change (EC), using provincial-level panel data of 30 provinces from 2002 to 2017 by applying a stochastic frontier approach (SFA). The paper also identifies determinants of TE, TC, and TFP using selected indicators from four hierarchical levels of the economy, i.e., farm level, production environment level, provincial level, and the state level, by applying a system-GMM method. Results reveal that agricultural labor, machinery, agricultural plastic film, and pesticides are the significant drivers of agricultural productivity, with no significant role of land area under cultivation. Constant returns to scale exist in China’s agriculture. The agricultural technical efficiency level fluctuated between 80% and 91% with a stable trend and a slight decline in later years, while TFP improved consistently over time, mainly driven by technological progress. Among the determinants, government investment in agricultural development projects significantly drives TC and TE, while the experienced labor force significantly increases TE. The disaster rate significantly reduces TE but promotes TC and TFP. The literacy rate significantly improves TC and TFP. However, government expenditures in “agriculture, forestry, and water” significantly reduce TE, TC, and TFP. Policy recommendations include (1) increased levels of mechanization and agriculture film use while avoiding an increase in pesticide use, (2) a continued increase in government expenditure in agricultural development projects, R&D to improve technological progress, and diffusion of modern agricultural technologies, and (3) investment in education targeted at the farming population in order to continue the growth in the productivity and sustainability of China’s agriculture.

Human capital efficiency is subdivided into executive (EHCE) and nonexecutive human capital efficiency (NHCE). We have sampled listed agriculture companies (LAC) in China’s Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share markets from 2009 to 2018 and categorized them as high-tech (HTAC) and non-high-tech agriculture companies (NHTAC). We find that capital employed efficiency (CEE) and EHCE have a significant positive effect on corporate sustainable growth (CSG) of HTAC but no significant effect on CSG of NHTAC, while FC has a significant positive effect on both. These results suggest that companies, especially HTAC, should invest in human capital, and their executives and policymakers should develop effective knowledge management tools and begin accumulating the necessary intellectual capital to allow adaptation to their changing environment. In the spirit of the intellectual agriculture concept, we present some new ways to study the performance of agricultural companies using intellectual capital and offer suggestions that can help to modernize the industry.

The main obstacle is that a large part of the water used in agriculture is unmetered. The objective of this study is to assess the Water Authorities (WA)’s choices between different options of incentive pricing policies (IPP) and to evaluate their economic performance compared with flat rate (FR) solutions. The applied method relies on a principal-agent model under adverse selection, in which WAs are less informed than farmers about the water use costs and profits. In this respect, the paper provides a theoretical interpretation of how different information conditions, profit and cost structures contribute to affecting WAs’ pricing strategies and their ability to deal with some of the WFD principles. The study shows that, in the absence of water metering, WAs can still set up incentive pricing strategies by formulating menus of contracts that are more efficient than flat rate payments. Also, we show that, at least for cases in which there is only a small differentiation in water costs among farmers or no transaction costs, the first-best solution (the solution that yields the highest return from the use of the resource) can also be optimal under asymmetric information. The main policy recommendation is that, in the absence of water metering, a wider set of incentive pricing options should be considered, the performance of which, however, should be evaluated based on the specificities of each irrigated region.

Dealing with food security requires more attention to how to protect peri-urban organic farming systems from urban pressures while strengthening the sustainability of local food systems. Given that short food supply chains (SFSCs) have been proven to be effective at reconnecting people with food production, this study focuses on identifying the barriers that hinder their development and the opportunities derived from the comparative advantage provided by their urban proximity. This study is based on documentary and empirical research addressing food supply chain characteristics in the organic sector. This study is focused on Mediterranean peri-urban agriculture, where, historically, there have been close relationships between the city and the countryside. These relationships are based on the fact that many cities are traditionally located next to areas of high agricultural activity, where a wide variety of vegetables is produced almost continuously due to the relatively mild winter climate. This study deals with two medium-sized metropolitan areas in Andalucía in the south of the Iberian Peninsula—the coastal city of Málaga, which is of a tourist-residential nature, and the inland urban agglomeration of Granada. Our research shows, when compared with other studies, that the local organic food sector seems to have great potential to find innovative solutions based on a collective approach, local embeddedness, and collective knowledge and by prioritizing horizontal and sustainable processes at the local/regional scale.

While advances in the application of geospatial information systems and remote sensing technologies offer much to agriculture, capturing and using that rich spatial biophysical information is not a feature available in most farm systems models. In this paper, we tackle this gap describing a land-based integrated grazing farm optimisation and resource allocation model (AgInform®) that departs from the use of whole farm and average data, to the integration of biological data obtained directly from each of the land units within the farm. The model allows the exploration of the dynamics of biophysical and financial performance of the farm in a steady-state, single-year approach, where the opening and closing values of the biological elements of the farm system conditions must remain the same (e.g., animal numbers, herbage mass), unless otherwise specified. The user supplies pasture growth rates, minimum and maximum acceptable pasture masses for each land management unit (LMU), differential boundary conditions to deliver defined environmental outcomes, animal performance (sheep, beef and deer), farm costs and market prices. The linear programming (LP) equations formed by AgInform® can be divided into a single objective and constraints (which accommodate the boundaries), including those placed on individual LMUs. The optimization routine uses this information to identify the mix of livestock production enterprises that maximises profit for the business. The model in maintaining the link between available pasture mass and livestock requirements for each LMU throughout all calculations, enables the livestock type and number carried, along with the pasture mass required on each LMU throughout the year to achieve the required animal performance levels to be included as model outputs. A hill land sheep and beef farm consisting of seven distinct LMUs was used as a farm-level case to assess if AgInform® (1) has sufficient flexibility to integrate biological information from each LMU; (2) could use the specified livestock performance targets to derive a feasible livestock policy that optimised resource use and farm returns; (3) can assign each fortnight animal type and number and herbage mass to each LMU; and (4) can mimic reality to produce credible solutions.

The present study aimed to quantify the potential nutrient production of urban agricultural vegetables and the resulting nutritional self-sufficiency throughout the year for mitigating post-disaster situations. Methods: We estimated the vegetable production of urban agriculture throughout the year. Two methods were developed to capture the production from professional and hobby farms: Method I utilized secondary governmental data on agricultural production from professional farms, and Method II was based on a supplementary spatial analysis to estimate the production from hobby farms. Next, the weight of produced vegetables [t] was converted into nutrients [kg]. Furthermore, the self-sufficiency by nutrient and time of year was estimated by incorporating the reference consumption of vegetables [kg], recommended dietary allowance of nutrients per capita [mg], and population statistics. The research was conducted in Nerima, the second most populous ward of Tokyo’s 23 special wards. Self-sufficiency rates were calculated with the registered residents. Results: The estimated total vegetable production of 5660 tons was equivalent to a weight-based self-sufficiency rate of 6.18%. The average nutritional self-sufficiencies of Methods I and II were 2.48% and 0.38%, respectively, resulting in an aggregated average of 2.86%. Fluctuations throughout the year were observed according to the harvest seasons of the available crops. Vitamin K (6.15%) had the highest self-sufficiency of selected nutrients, while calcium had the lowest (0.96%). Conclusions: This study suggests that depending on the time of year, urban agriculture has the potential to contribute nutrients to diets during post-disaster situations as disaster preparedness food. Emergency responses should be targeted according to the time of year the disaster takes place to meet nutrient requirements in periods of low self-sufficiency and prevent gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiovascular diseases among survivors.

New forms of urban agriculture are observed such as rooftop farming. In the case of low-tech rooftop farming projects, based on recycled urban waste, one of the key issues is the type of substrate used, as it determines the functions and ecosystem services delivered by the green roof. Using a five year experimental trial, we quantified the food production potential of Technosols created only with urban wastes (green waste compost, crushed wood, spent mushroom), as well as the soil fertility and the potential contamination of food products. Regarding food production, our cropping system showed promising results across the five years, in relation with the high fertility of the Technosols. This fertility was maintained, as well as the nutrients stocks after five cropping years. Most of the edible crops had trace metals contents below existing norms for toxic trace metals with nevertheless a concern regarding certain some trace metals such as Zn and Cu. There was no trace metal accumulation in the Technosols over time except for Zn.

Therefore, smart and efficient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential tools for agriculture development. Several new technologies and innovations are being implemented in agriculture as an alternative to collect and process farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor networks has triggered the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain of agriculture. This research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor networks with Artificial Intelligence systems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture land suitability. This proposed system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for cultivation in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input collected from the various sensor devices, which are used for training the system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden layers is found to be effective for the multiclass classification system when compared to the other existing model.

In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated.

This study is aimed at investigating the impacts of conservation agriculture on irrigation water use, nutrient availability in the root zone, and crop yield under supplementary irrigation. In this study, conservation agriculture (CA), which includes minimum soil disturbance, grass mulch cover, and crop rotation, was practiced and compared with conventional tillage (CT). We used two years’ (2018 and 2019) experimental data under paired-t design in the production of a local variety green pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). The results showed that CA practices significantly (α = 0.05) reduced irrigation water use (13% to 29%) and runoff (29% to 51%) while it increased percolated water in the root zone (27% to 50%) when compared with CT practices under the supplementary irrigation phase. In addition, CA significantly decreased NO3-N in the leachate (14% to 44%) and in the runoff (about 100%), while PO4-P significantly decreased in the leachate (33% to 50%) and in the runoff (16%) when compared with CT. Similarly, CA decreased the NO3-N load in the leachate and in the runoff, while the PO4-P load increased in the leachate but decreased in the runoff. The yield return that was achieved under CA treatment was 30% higher in 2018 and 10% higher in 2019 when compared with the CT. This research improves our understanding of water and nutrient dynamics in green pepper grown under CA and CT. Use of CA provides opportunities to optimize water use by decreasing irrigation water requirements and optimize nutrient use by decreasing nutrient losses through the runoff and leaching.

Our integrated results suggest that the agriculture development strategies, the signature of ECOWAP/CAADP by the national government, and political stability might explain the progress made towards poverty reduction and the improvement of food security. The results also show that agriculture-related SDGs in Cabo Verde are higher than the mean values obtained from the remaining West African countries, well above the top 25% WA countries.

For RPL, each secondary node selects a better parent according to some Objective Functions (OFs). We conducted simulations using Contiki Cooja 3.0, where we considered the Expected Transmission Count (ETX) and hop-count metric (HOP) metrics to evaluate energy consumption for three distinct topologies: tree, circular, and grid. The simulation results show that the circular topology had the best (lowest) energy consumption, being 15% better than the grid topology and 30% against the tree topology. The results help the need to improve the evolution of RPL metrics and motivate the network management of the topology.

The following research tasks were formulated: analysis of employment levels and GVA in the sectors of economy in 2000 and 2018 as well as the relationship between employment and GVA, assessment of GVA per 1 person employed in the investigated sectors and its changes in the analysed years, and assessment of the scale of surplus employment in agriculture assuming that GVA per 1 person employed in this sector would be equal to the average level reached in the industry and the services sectors. Comparative analysis and the deduction method were used in the study. Correlation coefficients between the level of employment in individual sectors and GVA per 1 person employed in the time series covering the years 2000–2008 were also calculated. A new measure of the “goal” of employment reduction in agriculture has been proposed, related to the measurement of the distance between agriculture and other sectors in terms of GVA generated per 1 employed—the Excess Employment Rate In The Agricultural Sector (EERAS). The research was based on EUROSTAT data from the years of 2000 and 2018. The process of changes in the sectoral structure of employment will probably be determined by the growth rate of demand for services, structural adjustment referring to matching the characteristics of the agricultural population to the demand for labour force in the services sector and the pace of structural transformations in rural areas. Rationalisation of employment levels in agriculture promotes improvement of its economic and social sustainability. Instruments based on financial transfers from nonagricultural sectors to agriculture should play a secondary role, since they are a burden to more efficient sectors, and in the long term, they may hinder reduction of employment in agriculture. However, due to the inevitable differences in productivity observed between agriculture and the nonagricultural sectors, at a technologically, economically, ecologically and socially justified level of employment in agriculture, transfers of the surplus generated in the secondary and tertiary sectors need at least to reduce, if not eliminate, economic consequences of these differences.

Locally embedded farms and bottom-linked approaches such as social cooperatives that act in the field of social agriculture are small, but valuable models to counteract these trends. This article is based on a case study conducted within the transdisciplinary research and development project Unlocking the Potential of Social Agriculture (UPAS), 2017–2020—financed by the Free University of Bolzano. The main focus of the case study is to determine the impact of social agriculture initiatives on social and healthcare systems, the natural environment and the communities in which they act. Data collection includes a literature review, observations and interviews carried out on 35 case studies of social agriculture initiatives, mainly located in Italy. The field research points out that actors in the sector of social agriculture predominantly aim to integrate disadvantaged people socially and in terms of their labor, base their production on organic methods, and that social agriculture has the potential to foster eco-social transformation and development of rural areas by the combination of social and ecological concerns. Thus, we use the term “eco-social” agriculture to describe these approaches. Furthermore, five components of eco-social agriculture have been defined, which, together, offer an ideal set of acting principles, namely: (1) the empowerment and integration of disadvantaged people, (2) the promotion of environmentally friendly agricultural practices, (3) the protection of nature, resources and cultural landscape, (4) support to the local community, and (5) education for sustainable development.

Alternatives like urban agriculture have emerged to reduce the negative social, environmental and health impacts of industrial agriculture. Such new food supply chains can change the way that people acquire and process food. This study looks at high-tech indoor gardening practices in nursing homes for elderly people, studying four nursing homes in the Dutch city of Velp. We used both qualitative and quantitative approaches to collect data, using site visits, a survey amongst employees, and semi-structured interviewees with residents and decision makers. Inspired by social practice theory, we aimed to understand the transformation of existing practices, investigating how the gardens affect cooking and eating practices, and how their constitutive elements of meaning, material and competences enable these transformations. Our work shows that the indoor gardens resulted in an integration of gardening and the resulting harvest into cooking practices, which in turn transformed residents’ eating practices. Appreciation of the taste of fresh vegetables and appearance of the meal decorated by fresh vegetables, as well as observing the growth of plants and their use, holds value for the elderly residents. Employees welcome the possibility to serve healthier meals. The integration of indoor gardens in existing cooking practices is more successful when employees have gardening and/or cooking competences, when they enjoy cooking and when they do not already cook with fresh ingredients. The gardens are more easily integrated when they are easily accessible. The materiality of the gardens does not require fully equipped kitchens.

However, in leisure agriculture management, managers must consider the dual characteristics of agricultural production technology and the leisure service industry. Therefore, managers often face various selection pressures during management decision-making. This study examined the following five evaluation aspects: organization and operation, leisure agricultural resources, environmental maintenance management, public facility maintenance management, and operational performance. Thereafter, according to the five evaluation aspects, 21 subprojects were further divided at the second level on the basis of different attributes. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was adopted to calculate the relative weights of various indicators, and the indicators were dynamically sorted according to their importance. Moreover, the study summarized the dynamic management indicators of leisure agriculture and contributed to research on leisure farming. The results show that managers’ approach toward leisure agriculture management can be divided into three types: active, moderate, and conservative. The indicators in which the active managers attach importance when managing leisure agricultural enterprises are clearly different from those valued by moderate and conservative managers. Finding managers who are suitable for leisure agriculture management is of great significance to leisure agriculture enterprises. Appointing managers with appropriate attitudes who can continuously improve the efficiency of enterprises and create a competitive advantage can bring sustainable business value to these enterprises.

Its implementation needs a change of mentality in the direction of an approach that takes into account how the increase in technologically induced productivity affects climate change. In the belief that the in-depth analysis conducted by scientific research plays a fundamental role, we explore the characteristics, actors, and pillars of CSA, examining both the scientific literature and financed projects. Specifically, through a systematic review of the literature we address both the application and barriers to implementation at a global level, and then we focus on a case study of the geographical distribution of CSA projects in Europe. Our results show a heterogeneous framework in which we can note discrepancies among countries. Finally, as conclusive remarks, we consider the type of policies that could be implemented to improve the diffusion of CSA in the near future.

The study area in northern Bangladesh included two union council areas under the Panchagarh sub-district. Climatological data analysis, a detailed questionnaire survey, and focus group discussions were conducted to assess farmers’ perceptions regarding the shifting and identification of hazards, their seasonal variation, and hazard prioritizations. The SMUG (seriousness, manageability, urgency, and growth) and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) models were applied for hazard prioritization. Hailstorms were found to be the most prioritized hazard over droughts and flash floods as perceived by the community. The farmers’ perceptions as evaluated through a questionnaire survey also support the findings of the SMUG and FEMA models. This was the first attempt to analyze the potential of hailstorms as a significant hazard in Bangladesh, and GIS maps showed their spatial distribution and temporal frequency across Bangladesh. This newly identified hazard is significantly diminishing farmers’ motivation to continue farming and has the potential to affect sustainable agriculture. The farmers’ perceptions, historical data analysis, use of the two models, institutional approach, hazard risk assessment, and vulnerability to the major sectors show that hailstorms should be considered as an important hazard in northern Bangladesh, and policymakers should pay urgent attention to minimize the threat to sustainable agriculture in northern Bangladesh.

Thus, the relationships between users and the ability of the UAPs to provide services are crucial. This study investigated the user profiles of three kinds of UAPs in Beijing, China. Investigation of 345 interviewees suggested that most of the users have an upper-middle level income and are well educated. Social connections vary across different types of UAPs. An assessment matrix of landscape services was introduced for a pioneer of UAP, Little Donkey Farm, based on questionnaires, a field survey, and indicators of landscape patterns. Pearson correlations between service demands and users’ characters showed age, companions, and education level were significantly correlated to the needs of scenery and education services. The landscape with the highest supply value was the vegetable plots planted by members. The scenery service was not adequately supplied, and 31.5% of the areas did not meet the demand. Based on the budgets of supply and demand, six types of landscape should be optimized. This study provides an approach to understand the path of landscape service provision in UAP and supports basic knowledge on how to better involve urban agriculture in sustainable development.

Urban and peri-urban agricultural land is often seen as available space for the city to expand, but at the same time, agricultural land provides many benefits to cities pertaining to food, employment, and eco-services. In this context, there is an urgent need to provide spatial information to support planning in complex urban systems. The challenge is to integrate analysis of agriculture and urban land-cover classes, and of their spatial and functional patterns. This paper takes up this challenge in Antananarivo (Madagascar), where agricultural plots and homes are interlocked and very small. It innovates by using a methodology already tested in rural settings, but never applied to urban environments. The key step of the analysis is to produce landscape zoning based on multisource satellite data to identify agri-urban functional areas within the city, and to explore their relationships. Our results demonstrate that the proposed classification method is well suited for mapping agriculture and urban land cover (overall accuracy = 76.56% for the 20 classes of level 3) in such a complex setting. The systemic analysis of urban agriculture patterns and functions can help policymakers and urban planners to design and build resilient cities.

Quantitative and qualitative methods were applied to the research, namely: descriptive statistical and economic analysis of the Polish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) data and Statistics Poland data, as well as case studies of organic food producers, covering the years 2005–2019. Indicated information sources, encompassing long time span of analysis and various data collections, allowed presenting the complementary picture of eco-innovations at the sector and farm levels. The research examined the different types of ecological innovations in Polish agriculture, including: (1) organisational innovations with an institutional background (e.g., the organic farming support and greening mechanism of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)—implemented in the family farming sector); and (2) the product, marketing, process and organisational innovations in selected organic farms that were individual farmers’ initiatives. On the one hand, the research documented the effectiveness of new agricultural policy solutions in the agricultural sector that are examples of organisational eco-innovations. During 2005–2016, the certification system, as well as policy support, contributed to the development of organic farms in Poland in terms of the growth in the share of this type of holdings in total (from 0.5% to 4.6%) and in the overall utilised agricultural area (UAA) (from 0.3% to 3.7%). Moreover, during 2014–2015, as a result of the greening in agricultural holdings, the area sown with pulses and papilionaceous, i.e., crops improving soil structure and protecting soils, rose by 174% and 161%, respectively. On the other hand, the case studies conducted showed that the food producers’ knowledge and skills combined with a favourable local economic and social situation, as well as institutional support, played a key role in the process of the emergence of eco-innovations. Among those factors, the respondents’ individual characteristics associated with attitudes towards farming and the social, human and physical capital passed on by family members should be highlighted. This paper contributes to existing literature in two ways. First, this study combines both quantitative and qualitative (including in-depth interviews) approaches to eco-innovations at the micro and macro level of analysis. Second, by differentiating two approaches to ecological innovations, namely the conventional and the sustainable, the article indicates and considers the key factors favourable to the latter.

Sustainability in agriculture can be achieved through using less (or no) poisonous chemicals, saving natural resources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Technology applications could help farmers to use proper data in decision-making, which leads to low-input agriculture. This work focuses on the role of smart technology implementation in sustainable agriculture. The effects of smart technology implementation are analyzed by using a case study approach. The results show that the plant factory using intelligence technology enhances sustainability performance by increasing production productivity, product quality, crop per year, resource use efficiency, and food safety, as well as improving employees’ quality of life.

The new century enhanced the calls for economic diversification, with the agricultural, manufacturing, and services sectors amongst those pronounced. This article focused on the role of agriculture in supporting the economy, particularly, the effect of agriculture on economic growth. The data analyzed was reviewed for the period 1983–2017. The ARDL Bounds Test was applied in order to meet the said objectives. The ECM results suggest that agriculture, manufacturing, services, and mining converge to an equilibrium and affect economic growth at the speed of adjustment of 90.6%, with the effect from agriculture, mining, and services being significant. The impact of agriculture on economic growth was significant in both the short-run and long-run, with coefficient unit effects of 0.428 and 0.342, respectively. The effects are strong because more than two-thirds of the rural population rely on farming, and agriculture has stood as a catalyst for food security. For the effect of agriculture to be much more profound, farmers must be supported with adequate infrastructure, accessibility to markets, farming inputs, better irrigation techniques, which would address the problem of reliance on rain, all of which were inconsistent in the last decade. Additionally, governments must ensure the institutionalization of food processing industries which add more value to the national income.

To this objective, a broad exploration of data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer sensors (MODIS) was made using pixel time-series combined with time-series similarity metrics. The experiment was performed in Brazil, covered 61% of the total agriculture areas, five different states specifically selected to demonstrate biome differences and the country’s diversity. The validation was made against independent data from EMBRAPA (Brazilian Agriculture Research Corporation), RapidEye Sensor Scene Maps. For the eight tested algorithms, the results were enhanced and demonstrate that the method can rate the classification accuracy up to 98.5%, average value for the tested algorithms. The process can be used to timely monitor large areas dedicated to row crops and enables the application of state of art classification techniques, two levels classification process, to identify crops according to each specific need within the areas.

The demand for community supported agriculture (CSA), bringing people spatially, economically, and socially closer to food, is continuously expanding. CSAs play an important role in both sustainable agriculture practices and influencing consumers’ food-related practices, but yet have received little attention in well-being research. Methods: This study explores food-related well-being among CSA members by using an exploratory, qualitative research design and a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. Results: The findings stress the relevance of psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of food-related well-being beyond the nutritional characteristics of food in CSA. Conclusion: The role of sustainable agriculture in contributing to food-related well-being becomes particularly evident based on consumers’ experiences. These results are important in convincing people that their food-related experiences belong to their perceived well-being as well as stimulating people to elevate their multidimensional expectations in relation to food.

Overall, the world agricultural TFP grew at a rate of 0.44% p.a. This growth was mainly contributed to by technological progress and mix efficiency changes, while the contributions of technical efficiency and scale efficiency changes were negligible. TFP growth varied across regions, with South Asia at the top of the list (1.05% p.a.), and East Asia and the Pacific (0.18% p.a.) at the bottom. TFP components exerted differential influences amongst regions. For instance, mix efficiency played a dominant role in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, whereas it was technical efficiency change in Latin America and the Caribbean region. The paper argues for region specific policy interventions emphasizing technical progress through investment in R&D and price and non-price interventions to improve economies of scope and scale of operation in the agricultural sector.

From a theoretical perspective, the authors develop a general framework to estimate the effective rate of protection using an input–output table, taking into account tariffs, subsidies and value-added tax. Based on the data of 2012 and 2016, with a projection to 2020, the empirical results reveal that agricultural production, which is considered as Vietnam’s comparative advantage, is insignificantly protected. From the year 2012 to 2016, the effective rate of protection declined for primary agriculture and its supporting sectors, and would become negative by 2020. This implies that Vietnamese farmers are at a disadvantage due to the effect of trade liberalization. Furthermore, it is empirically revealed that the primary agricultural sector has a high value-added multiplier, which means a significant contribution to the domestic economy, is not protected by the government’s tax and tariff policies. Based on the study results, the authors suggest some policy recommendations to improve the situation, which are focused on the reduction of the value-added tax rate on inputs, while making industries with a high spillover effect to the domestic economy a key priority.

As climate change conditions continue to develop, we anticipate more frequent occurrences of abiotic stresses such as drought, high temperature and salinity. Living plants, which are sessile beings, are more exposed to environmental extremes. However, plants are equipped with biosynthetic machinery operating to supply thousands of bio-compounds required for maintaining internal homeostasis. In addition to chemical coordination within a plant, these compounds have the potential to assist plants in tolerating, resisting and escaping biotic and abiotic stresses generated by the external environment. Among certain biosynthates, flavonoids are an important example of these stress mitigators. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites and biostimulants; they play a key role in plant growth by inducing resistance against certain biotic and abiotic stresses. In addition, the function of flavonoids as signal compounds to communicate with rhizosphere microbes is indispensable. In this review, the significance of flavonoids as biostimulants, stress mitigators, mediators of allelopathy and signaling compounds is discussed. The chemical nature and biosynthetic pathway of flavonoid production are also highlighted.

The highest-yielding varieties under organic conditions were Pizarro and Subito. Borowik cultivar showed the highest competitive ability against weeds. The highest number of weeds was found in the Leontyno cultivar, which was connected to the lowest plant density, the lowest weight of the above-ground parts of the canopy and smaller value of tillering coefficient. The most affected by the fungal pathogens Drechslera tritici-repentis (Died.) Shoem. and Puccinia striiformis Schwein. were Fredro and Algoso. Cluster analyses indicated that the most useful cultivars for cultivation in the organic system were: Borowik, Subito, and Tomko, which all showed higher yielding potential, bigger competitiveness against weeds, and average resistance against fungal pathogens. Pizarro, Tulus, and Twingo, which showed high resistance to fungal pathogens with lower competitiveness to weeds, were classified to the second group of usefulness. The least useful for the organic system were: Algoso, Fredro, Grenado, and Leontyno.

Drought causes oxidative stress on plants, arising from excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inadequate CO2, which disrupts the photosynthetic machinery of plants. The use of conventional methods for the development of drought-tolerant crops is time-consuming, and the full adoption of modern biotechnology for crop enhancement is still regarded with prudence. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach for enhancing crop growth under environmental stress. The various direct and indirect mechanisms used for plant growth enhancement by PGPR were discussed. Synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane−1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase enhances plant nutrient uptake by breaking down plant ACC, thereby preventing ethylene accumulation, and enable plants to tolerate water stress. The exopolysaccharides produced also improves the ability of the soil to withhold water. PGPR enhances osmolyte production, which is effective in reducing the detrimental effects of ROS. Multifaceted PGPRs are potential candidates for biofertilizer production to lessen the detrimental effects of drought stress on crops cultivated in arid regions. This review proffered ways of augmenting their efficacy as bio-inoculants under field conditions and highlighted future prospects for sustainable agricultural productivity.

In this context, this study investigates how consumers’ psychological (i.e., attitudes and social norms) and socio-economic characteristics affect their willingness to pay (WTP) for sustainable agricultural products. To this end, the study incorporates attitude and social norms as components of the theory of reasoned action into the contingent valuation method, thereby establishing an estimation model for consumers’ WTP. Based on an online market survey of adults in South Korea from June to July 2018, the results show that consumers’ attitudes and social norms positively affect WTP for the rice and loach produced through integrated agriculture–aquaculture (IAA). However, the variables in the model affect consumers’ WTP differently, depending on the type of IAA product. For IAA rice, both socio-economic (e.g., income) and psychological variables affect WTP. However, in the case of IAA loach, only social norms are statistically significant in affecting consumers’ WTP.

Precision Agriculture (PA) along with Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the main drivers of automation in the agriculture domain. PA uses specific sensors and software to ensure that the crops receive exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the sensors deployed in the fields. High-resolution images of crops are obtained from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned or unmanned), which are further processed to extract information used to provide future decisions. In this paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain is presented along with several considerations and challenges. This survey includes wireless communication technologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms used to obtain spectral images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral images and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a case study showing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an IoT-based smart solution for crop health monitoring, which is comprised of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network-based system to monitor real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed to classify healthy and unhealthy crops.

Basic essentials such as food, beverages, clothes and domestic materials are enriched by the agricultural industry. However, the traditional method in agriculture cultivation is labor-intensive and inadequate to meet the accelerating nature of human demands. This scenario raises the need to explore state-of-the-art crop cultivation and harvesting technologies. In this regard, optics and photonics technologies have proven to be effective solutions. This paper aims to present a comprehensive review of three photonic techniques, namely imaging, spectroscopy and spectral imaging, in a comparative manner for agriculture applications. Essentially, the spectral imaging technique is a robust solution which combines the benefits of both imaging and spectroscopy but faces the risk of underutilization. This review also comprehends the practicality of all three techniques by presenting existing examples in agricultural applications. Furthermore, the potential of these techniques is reviewed and critiqued by looking into agricultural activities involving palm oil, rubber, and agro-food crops. All the possible issues and challenges in implementing the photonic techniques in agriculture are given prominence with a few selective recommendations.

However, impetuous agricultural expansion and poor resource management (e.g., over-irrigation, inefficient techniques) over the past decades have raised a number of challenges. In this exploratory study, we introduce an open access GIS-based model to help answer selected timely questions related to the agriculture, water and energy nexus in the region. First, the model uses spatial and tabular data to identify the location and extent of irrigated cropland. Then, it employs spatially explicit climatic datasets and mathematical formulation to estimate water and electricity requirements for groundwater irrigation in all identified locations. Finally, it evaluates selected supply options to meet the electricity demand and suggests the least-cost configuration in each location. Results indicate that full irrigation in the basin requires ~3.25 billion million m3 per year. This translates to ~730 GWh of electricity. Fossil fuels do provide the least-cost electricity supply option due to lower capital and subsidized operating costs. Hence, to improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies (RT) (i.e., solar), a support scheme to drop the capital cost of RTs is critically needed. Finally, moving towards drip irrigation can lead to ~47% of water abstraction savings in the NWSAS area.

The results determined that the entrepreneurial commitment and communication aspects of entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) considerably affected the conviction dimension of AEI, whereas entrepreneurial commitment, communication ESE, entrepreneurial attitude, planning ESE, and neuroticism notably influenced the preparation dimension of AEI. Furthermore, the effects of neuroticism on entrepreneurial conviction were weaker in younger farmers than in older farmers, and the effects of entrepreneurial commitment, entrepreneurial attitude, neuroticism, and planning ESE on entrepreneurial preparation in younger farmers were different from those in older farmers. Moreover, length of agricultural engagement exhibited an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship with AEIs. The present study contributes to the understanding of how younger farmers’ AEIs can be shaped and how they may cope with the differences they may have compared with older family members.

However, social factors can also play a role. We aimed to clarify how the cropping system is maintained through examining sociocultural factors, specifically land tenure and marriage systems, in an agricultural community in rural mountainous Africa. Several surveys based on participatory observation accompanied by home stays were conducted to determine people who participated in cropping systems and to understand which social system maintained the cropping system. We found that around 70% of target households in Kiboguwa village cultivated three staple crops (maize, cassava and rice) using the same cropping system and almost no farmers outside the village used the village’s sloped fields, meaning that the villagers maintained the cropping system. Households acquired nearby sloped fields by various means such as inheriting land through maternal lineage of household heads or wives. We observed virilocal and uxorilocal residence at similar degrees—and if either the husband or wife was from outside the village, that household would also have fields outside the village. However, nearly 80% of marriages were intravillage and villagers predominantly used fields located within the village limits regardless of the residence type, which helped maintain the cropping system.

The results confirm the relevance of risk management adoption decisions and reveal that the use of one risk management tool may simultaneously influence the use of another risk management tool. In addition, the research results also show that age, education level, extension experience, monthly household income, farming areas, land ownership and risk aversion nature are the most important factors that affect the adoption of risk management strategies. The research results provide further explanation and information and provide a platform for decision-makers to predict appropriate risk management strategies.

Vegetable production is labor intensive and prone to pests and diseases. Conservation agriculture (CA) and integrated pest management (IPM) practices provide options to increase yields and minimize the use of chemical pesticides. We compared integration of CA and IPM practices (improved alternative system) with farmers’ traditional practice (conventional system) under replicated on-farm tests in four different locations (Lalitpur, Banke, Surkhet, and Dadeldhura) in Nepal. Data on yield, benefit–cost ratio (B:C), labor requirement, insect and disease infestation, and pesticide sprays on five major vegetable crops (tomato, cucumber, bitter gourd, cabbage, cauliflower) were measured. In tomatoes, cucumbers, and bitter gourds, the improved alternative system produced a significantly higher yield, greater benefit-cost ratio, reduced labor, decreased the infestation of pests and diseases, and required fewer pesticidal sprays. Average yield and net income were superior in cabbages and cauliflowers, but nonsignificant. Improved alternative system for all the vegetables were sprayed significantly fewer times than the conventional system. Overall, the improved alternative system for vegetable crops contributed not only to the improved income and livelihoods of people, but also can improve environment and human health due to the reduced use of pesticides. Further research on scaling these improved alternative practices through appropriate farmer organizations, and government and non-government actors can enhance the adoption of CA and IPM practices by smallholder vegetable producers.

The M-R model was employed to construct an integrated model of the influence of consumer landscape on pro-environment behavior and loyalty in organic agricultural tourism. The research framework and questionnaire design were constructed on the basis of literature review and 417 valid questionnaires which were collected from tourists in Eastern Taiwan (Hualien and Taidong). SPSS was employed to analyze the reliability and validity of the questionnaire and LISREL software was used to identify the influence path between variables. The results showed that: 1. The tourists’ cognition of consumer landscape will positively affect the environmental intimacy and environmental identity. 2. Tourists’ environmental intimacy and environmental identity will increase their pro-environmental behavior. 3. Tourists’ pro-environment behavior has a positive impact on their loyalty to organic agricultural tourism. The results show that organic agricultural tourism can stimulate tourists to understand the significance, importance and multiple values of the environment, and increase the intimacy and identity of tourists to the environment, which has a great effect on pro-environment behavior and loyalty. At the same time, it also shows that organic agricultural tourism is a sustainable tourism mode, which is worth promoting.

By the time ‘land’ animals arrived on the scene, terrestrial plants were plentiful and varied, and herbivorous diets developed in concert with the food sources most commonly available. However, skip forward several hundred millennia, and with the advent of agriculture, approximately 10,000 years ago, dietary diversity began to change. Today, the world is experiencing increasingly higher rates of debilitating, non-communicable diseases—might there be a connection? This paper reviews scientific evidence for the judicious use of various seaweeds in the reduction of heat stress, enhanced immunity, improved growth performance, and methane reduction in animals. The extensive, (super) prebiotic effects of selected macroalgae will also be highlighted. Key studies conducted across the animal kingdom provide considerable support that there is an overwhelming need for the guided and wise applications of increased usage of selected seaweeds in feed, food and supplements. Particular attention will be paid to the bioactive components, and nutraceutical qualities, of various seaweeds, i.e., the brown, Saccharina (Laminaria) spp. and Ascophyllum nodosum, and the red alga Chondrus crispus. Suggestions are put forward for benefits to be derived from their further applications.

This article focuses on biodegradable and synthetic plastics used in farms as mulching materials and shade materials/greenhouse covering materials (shade nets and plastic films) to protect plants from pests and extreme weather. The sustainability was determined by three factors, carbon footprint from cradle to the end of life (LCA), durability (resistance to photo-oxidation and high tensile strength), and affordability. The LCA analyses showed that the production of polyethylene (PE) requires less energy and generates low quantities of greenhouse gas equivalents. Beyond the LCA data, biodegradable polymers are sustainable based on biodegradability and compostability, ability to suppress weeds, control soil temperatures, and moisture, and augment fertigation and drip irrigation. However, existing technologies are a limiting factor because lab-based innovations have not been commercialized. In addition, industrial production of shade nets, plastic greenhouse covers, and mulching materials are limited to synthetic plastics. The bio-based plastic materials are sustainable based on biodegradability, and resistant to photo-oxidation. The resistance to UV degradation is an essential property because solar radiation cleaves C-C bonds, which in turn impact the mechanical strength of the materials. In brief, the sustainability of plastics in farms is influenced by LCA data, mechanical and optical properties, and performance relative to other materials.

The methodology used was participant observation. The following procedures were used to produce the data: participation in three workshops, direct observation, field notes, and an in-depth interview with two of the organizers and three participants. The results show that the Network engendered the formation of a popular feminist collective identity, as it fostered the awareness of oppressive social structures, such as gender inequality and violence against women, of which many participants were survivors. From a technical standpoint, the Network seeks to expand its scope of action, increase the number of participants, establish new partnerships and access multiple sources of funding to obtain greater autonomy from São Paulo City Council.

Urban agriculture (UA) seems a viable intervention to address urban food insecurity, however, experience has shown that urban gardens do not expand at the expected rate. Tackling this issue requires a deeper understanding of the main constraints that block UA expansion. Benin is not an exception; the country witnesses a breathtaking growth of its main cities that is in synchronization with a mounting food insecurity. Our research aims, therefore, to identify the main constraints for the expansion of UA in Benin, and adopt a three-pronged approach combined with a systematic literature review, a survey held among experienced urban gardeners, and in-depth interviews with stakeholders. Altogether, the synthesis shows a predominance of five main constraints: lack of land and tenure insecurity, insufficient government support, restricted market access, limited access to productive factors, and inequality issues. Specifically, while the review showed that most barriers are linked and could be tackled together, the survey indicated a political unwillingness which in our in-depth interviews is explained by the unperceived benefits of investing in UA and the lack of enforcement of urban development plans. We suggest that Beninese authorities and academics move in synchronization where the former coordinates the planning of urban gardens and the latter provides evidence to trigger public and private investments in UA. The findings could be the basis for further research on UA in West Africa and the wider continent.

However, after years of significant growth in prices, a slowdown in pace and demand is expected. Rising interest rates, a strengthening of the crown and legislative changes in 2018 have influenced the price of farmland. Yet the prices of farmland in Czechia are a third of those in the countries of Western Europe, and so it still represents an interesting opportunity for investors. Currently, land is bought primarily by the farmers who work it. In Czechia, 80% of farmers farm on hired land, and rent increases are starting to be an issue for many of them. The return on the investment in agricultural land is currently around 50 years for an owner and 25 years for a farmer working the land. As research has shown, the price of farmland is an important factor in the sustainable development of agriculture in Czechia, along with the greening of production and the fight against soil erosion and the effects of climate change.

Three years of field experiments were carried out from 2015 to 2017 in the Lubelskie province (Poland) on rendzina soils. The experimental results indicate that the hulled wheats, even when cultivated with advanced technology, produced lower yields compared to the common and durum wheats (reduced by 30–56%). In spite of their lower yields, emmer and spelt retained appropriate technological parameters. Higher ash, protein, and wet gluten yields were characteristic of the hulled wheats; however, the high gluten spread of emmer (13.3 mm) may limit its application as a raw material in some food processes. In summary, hulled wheat species can be recommended for modern agricultural production as an alternative source of high-quality materials for the agricultural and food industries.

The purpose of the article lies in the presentation of the author’s concept of the social and economic conditions where the transformation of economic relations between agrofood market participants is happening—in particular, the livestock products market of Ukraine—and the assessment of the state of food security of the country, as well as a comparison, by the same criteria, of the conditions of agrofood market participants in Ukraine and in four European countries: Germany, France, Italy, and Poland. This research was based on the application of empirical knowledge methods: observation, comparison, description, measurement, statistic methods, etc. So far, the participant functioning conditions in the agricultural market in Ukraine are unfavorable for the sustainable development of agriculture, especially the livestock industry. The debt burden of external creditors is growing, the amount of direct investments from the countries of the world decreases, and the growth of capital investment in terms of calculation per one employee is slowing down. The food security of Ukraine is unstable. The “market” itself is not capable of remedying all the negative phenomena. Therefore, it is necessary to apply the weighted power of the state.

This article analyses the dynamics of worldwide research on this topic over the last two decades. To do this, a review including a qualitative systematic analysis and a quantitative bibliometric analysis was carried out on a sample of 951 articles. The results reveal that this line of research is becoming more relevant within agricultural research, particularly in recent years. The research in this topic has focused on the sustainable development of vulnerable regions, the contribution to the agronomic improvement of crops and farms, environmental impact assessment, the joint management of water resources, the restoration of groundwater bodies, and the use of rainfall. Gaps have been found in the literature with respect to the capacity of irrigation ponds to cover the irrigation needs in different agricultural contexts, the perceptions and attitudes of farmers towards the use of irrigation ponds, and the economic–financial feasibility of these systems.

In Italy, about one-third of injuries involve the upper extremity, with long-term consequences for the workers and economic damage for agricultural companies and farms. This systematic review describes upper limb injuries among farmworkers, especially hand injuries, and highlights the main dangerous risk factors. Literature review included articles published in the major databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus), using a combination of some relevant keywords. This online search yielded 951 references; after selection, the authors analyzed 53 articles (3 narrative reviews and 50 original articles). From this analysis, it appears that younger male farmers are mostly involved, especially in the harvesting season. The upper limb and hand are often the body parts that sustain most damage as these are mostly involved in driving tractors or tools. The most frequent type of lesions are open wounds, lacerations, fractures, strains, and overexertion lesions. Sometimes, a distracting element (such as mobile phone use, quarrels, working hours load) is present; poor use of protective devices and lack of safety design in tools can also increase the risk of accidents. For these reasons, in the agricultural sector, a system of health promotion and good practices is needed to promote workers’ awareness of the sources of risk, highlight more dangerous situations and apply organizational behavioral measures.

The food and agriculture sector is considered to be a major employer at a worldwide level. The large number and heterogeneity of the stakeholders involved from different sectors, such as farmers, distributers, retailers, consumers, etc., renders the agricultural supply chain management as one of the most complex and challenging tasks. It is the same vast complexity of the agriproducts supply chain that limits the development of global and efficient transparency and traceability solutions. The present paper provides an overview of the application of blockchain technologies for enabling traceability in the agri-food domain. Initially, the paper presents definitions, levels of adoption, tools and advantages of traceability, accompanied with a brief overview of the functionality and advantages of blockchain technology. It then conducts an extensive literature review on the integration of blockchain into traceability systems. It proceeds with discussing relevant existing commercial applications, highlighting the relevant challenges and future prospects of the application of blockchain technologies in the agri-food supply chain.

Field data was collected from more than 1000 farmers (involved in over 50 varieties of crops) in 22 riverine and coastal case study areas. Data was collected through site visits, surveys and five workshops conducted between November 2018 and June 2019. Based on the collected data sets, a new Agricultural Coastal Vulnerability Index (AGCVI) was developed and applied to the 22 sites located in two districts (Krishna and Guntur) of Coastal Andhra Pradesh. The analysis revealed that the areas with three crop seasons (Kharif, Rabi and Zaid) per year are highly vulnerable to climate change. On the other hand, sites with one crop season (Kharif) per annum are the least vulnerable to climate change. Moreover, grains (particularly rice), flowers and fruit crops are more susceptible to climate change and its induced impacts. Rice is no longer a profitable crop in the case study areas partly as a result of unfavourable weather conditions, inadequate insurance provision and lack of government support for farmers. Cumulatively, all these circumstances impact farmers’ incomes and socio-cultural practices: this is leading to a marriage crisis, with a reduction in the desirability of matrimony to farmers. These findings provide valuable information that can support climate and agriculture policies, as well as sustainable cropping patterns among farmers’ communities in coastal areas of India in the future.

This treatment improves soil quality, increases crops yields, and sequestrates atmospheric carbon to the soil. Another widely studied aspect connecting biochar with agriculture is the composting processes of various agricultural waste with the addition of biochar. Obtaining the material via the pyrolysis of agricultural waste, including animal manure, has also been investigated. However, given the remarkable properties of biochar, its application potential could be utilized in other areas not yet thoroughly investigated. This review paper summarizes the last decade of research on biochar and its use in crop agriculture and livestock production. Knowledge gaps are highlighted, such as using biochar for the mitigation of odorous emissions from animal manure and by feeding the biochar to animals.

Yet, little is known about the health impacts of WSD projects, especially on nutrition, vector breeding, water quality and the distribution of impacts. We conducted a qualitative study to deepen the understanding on perceived health impacts of completed WSD projects in four villages of Kolar district, India. Field data collection comprised: (i) focus group discussions with local women (n = 2); (ii) interviews (n = 40; purposive sampling) with farmers and labourers, project employees and health workers; and (iii) transect walks. Our main findings were impacts perceived on nutrition (e.g., food security through better crop survival, higher milk consumption from livestock, alongside increased pesticide exposure with expanded agriculture), potential for mosquito larval breeding (e.g., more breeding sites) and through opportunistic activities (e.g., reduced mental stress due to improved water access). Impacts perceived varied between participant categories (e.g., better nutrition in woman-headed households from livelihood support). Some of these findings, e.g., potential negative health implications, have previously not been reported. Our observations informed a health impact assessment of a planned WSD project, and may encourage implementing agencies to incorporate health considerations to enhance positive and mitigate negative health impacts in future WSD projects.

Using monthly climate and agriculture data, the influence of drought on maize and soybean yields—two of the main crops in the region—in northeast China since 1961 to 2017 were investigated. The results showed that the temperature in the growing season increased by 1.0 °C from the period 1998–2017 to the period 1961–1980, while the annual precipitation decreased slightly. However, precipitation trends varied throughout the growing season (May–September), increasing slightly in May and June, but decreasing in July, August and September, associated with the weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon. Consequently, the annual and growing season drought frequency increased by 15%, and 25%, respectively, in the period 1998–2017 relative to the period 1961–1980. The highest drought frequency (55%) was observed in September. At the same time, the drought intensity during the growing season increased by 7.8%. The increasing frequency and intensity of drought had negative influences on the two crops. During moderate drought years in the period 1961–2017, 3.2% and 10.4% of the provincial maize and soybean yields were lost, respectively. However, during more severe drought years, losses doubled for soybean (21.8%), but increased more than four-fold for maize (14.0%). Moreover, in comparison to the period 1961–1980, a higher proportion of the yields were lost in the period 1998–2017, particularly for maize, which increased by 15% (increase for soybean was 2.4%). This change largely depends on increasing droughts in August and September, when both crops are in their filling stages. The impact of drought on maize and soybean production was different during different growth stages, where a strong relationship was noted between drought and yield loss of soybean in its filling stage. Given the sensitivity of maize and soybean yields in northeast China to drought, and the observed production trends, climate change will likely have significant negative impacts on productivity in the future.

There are currently studies on integrons and antibiotic resistance genes; however, the presence and association of integrons in different agricultural crops and their subsequent dissemination and role in AMR have not been reported previously. This study examines the abundance of integrons, their gene cassette diversity in various crop soils, and their role in the dissemination of AMR in the southern region of China. Samples from different agri-crop soil, such as rice (R.S), sugarcane (S.S), citrus (C.S), banana (B.S), agricultural runoff (the point where the runoff of all sites meet (R.O)), and wild (non-agricultural) soil (W.S), were collected. Quantitative PCR was used to determine the abundance of integrons, and clone libraries were constructed to examine the gene cassette arrays. All the tested samples were found positive for Class-I (CL1) integrons and revealed a higher concentration and higher relative abundance of R.S than the others, with the least found at the W.S site. The W.S CL1 cassette arrays were found empty, and no putative conserved domains were found. The R.O was found to contain a high number of gene cassettes with various functions, while the smallest number of gene cassettes was found in the S.S among the crop soils. Most of the gene cassettes presented by the R.O were primarily shared with other sites, and the antibiotic-resistant genes were consistently observed to be dominant. The constructed clone libraries represented a diverse gene cassette array with 16% novel gene cassettes that play a vital role in pathogenesis, transportation, biosynthesis, and AMR. Most resistance-related gene cassettes were associated with the genes encoding resistance to quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) and aminoglycosides. This study highlights the significant differences in the abundance of integrons among various agricultural soils and offers deep insight into the pools of gene cassettes that play a key role in the dissemination of integrons and AMR.

However, if more plant nutrients are deposited than the plant can absorb, the excess nitrogen seeps into the soil where it accumulates as nitrate. About 74% of the drinking water produced in Germany comes from groundwater. The legal limit of 50 milligrams of nitrate per liter of fresh water is exceeded frequently in Germany, especially in agricultural areas. High levels of nitrate in drinking water can quickly lead to health issues, under certain conditions. The nitrate problem is omnipresent in Germany. However, studies which determine the externalized costs of nitrogen eutrophication are mostly missing. The present study closes this gap by combining the results of a transdisciplinary investigation from hydrological analyses and environmental-economic calculations. Water samples were taken from a deep well in Hauneck, which is a municipality in Hesse (Germany). Afterwards, an isotope analysis was carried out to determine the groundwater residence time and possible sources of nitrate. Thus, in addition to the sources of pollution, concrete social costs were determined, using a damage cost approach as well as an avoidance cost approach. For Hauneck, it was found that about 54% of the drinking water price is directly linked to the externalization of costs. These are borne via the principle of the common burden. In addition, the isotope investigations have shown that the removal of excess nitrate will continue for decades, which will lead to long term external costs. The paper reveals how the internalization of these costs can contribute to the conservation of water resources.

In this paper, we study the potential of a laser speckle system as a low-cost solution for non-destructive phenotyping. The objective is to assess an original approach combining laser speckle with chemometrics to describe scattering and absorption properties of sunflower leaves, related to their chemical composition or internal structure. A laser diode system at two wavelengths 660 nm and 785 nm combined with polarization has been set up to differentiate four sunflower genotypes. REP-ASCA was used as a method to analyze parameters extracted from speckle patterns by reducing sources of measurement error. First findings have shown that measurement errors are mostly due to unwilling residual specular reflections. Moreover, results outlined that the genotype significantly impacts measurements. The variables involved in genotype dissociation are mainly related to scattering properties within the leaf. Moreover, an example of genotype classification using REP-ASCA outcomes is given and classify genotypes with an average error of about 20%. These encouraging results indicate that a laser speckle system is a promising tool to compare sunflower genotypes. Furthermore, an autonomous low-cost sensor based on this approach could be used directly in the field.

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) plays an important role in the revegetation and rehabilitation of rainfed areas by modulating plant growth and metabolism and improving the fertility status of the rhizosphere soils. The current study explored the positive role of PGPR and salicylic acid (SA) on the health of the rhizosphere soil and plants grown under rainfed conditions. Maize seeds of two different varieties, i.e., SWL-2002 (drought tolerant) and CZP-2001 (drought sensitive), were soaked for 4 h prior to sowing in 24-h old culture of Planomicrobium chinense strain P1 (accession no. MF616408) and Bacillus cereus strain P2 (accession no. MF616406). The foliar spray of SA (150 mg/L) was applied on 28-days old seedlings. The combined treatment of the consortium of PGPR and SA not only alleviated the adverse effects of low moisture stress of soil in rainfed area but also resulted in significant accumulation of leaf chlorophyll content (40% and 24%), chlorophyll fluorescence (52% and 34%) and carotenoids (57% and 36%) in the shoot of both the varieties. The PGPR inoculation significantly reduced lipid peroxidation (33% and 23%) and decreased the proline content and antioxidant enzymes activities (32% and 38%) as compared to plants grown in rainfed soil. Significant increases (>52%) were noted in the contents of Ca, Mg, K Cu, Co, Fe and Zn in the shoots of plants and rhizosphere of maize inoculated with the PGPR consortium. The soil organic matter, total nitrogen and C/N ratio were increased (42%), concomitant with the decrease in the bulk density of the rhizosphere. The PGPR consortium, SA and their combined treatment significantly enhanced the IAA (73%) and GA (70%) contents but decreased (55%) the ABA content of shoot. The rhizosphere of plants treated with PGPR, SA and consortium showed a maximum accumulation (>50%) of IAA, GA and ABA contents, the sensitive variety had much higher ABA content than the tolerant variety. It is inferred from the results that rhizosphere soil of treated plants enriched with nutrients content, organic matter and greater concentration of growth promoting phytohormones, as well as stress hormone ABA, which has better potential for seed germination and establishment of seedlings for succeeding crops.

This scenario highlights the urgent need for agricultural modernization as a crucial step to face forthcoming difficulties. Precision agriculture techniques appear as a feasible option to help solve these problems. However, their use needs to be reinvented and tested according to different parameters, in order to define both the environmental and the economic impact of these new technologies not only on agricultural production, but also on agricultural sustainability. This paper intends, therefore, to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of precision agriculture through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)/remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) techniques in small Mediterranean farms. We present specific data obtained through the application of the aforementioned techniques in three farms located along the Portuguese-Spanish border, considering three parameters (seeding failure, differentiated irrigation and differentiated fertilization) in order to determine not only the ecological benefits of these methods, but also their economic and productivity aspects. The obtained results, based on these methods, highlight the fact that an efficient combination of UAV/RPAS and NDVI techniques allows for important economic savings in productivity factors, thus promoting a sustainable agriculture both in ecological and economic terms. Additionally, contrary to what is generally defended, even in small farms, as the ones assessed in this study (less than 50 ha), the costs associated with the application of the aforementioned precision agriculture processes are largely surpassed by the economic gains achieved with their application, regardless of the notorious environmental benefits introduced by the reduction of crucial production inputs as water and fertilizers.

By striving for sustainable economic development and growth, as well as preservation of the ecosystem, organic agricultural production aims to produce high-quality food. Within the socio-economic space, the role of the state as a regulator of production and market relations is indispensable. The state often uses fiscal policy as an instrument for the regulation of relations in the sphere of production and trade. The level of the tax burden is of vital importance for achieving a sustainable level of agricultural development. From the aspect of the Serbian economy, the taxation of agriculture in the future period must be based on a system of tax incentives for organic production.

These WSNs allow real time monitoring, enabling intelligent decision-making to maximize yields and minimize cost. Designing and deploying a WSN is a challenging and multivariate task, dependent on the considered environment. For example, a need for network synchronization arises in such networks to correlate acquired measurements. This work focuses on the design and installation of a WSN that is capable of facilitating the sensing aspects of smart and precision agriculture applications. A system is designed and implemented to address specific design requirements that are brought about by the considered environment. A simple synchronization scheme is described to provide time-correlated measurements using the sink node’s clock as reference. The proposed system was installed on an olive grove to assess its effectiveness in providing a low-cost system, capable of acquiring synchronized measurements. The obtained results indicate the system’s overall effectiveness, revealing a small but expected difference in the acquired measurements’ time correlation, caused mostly by serial transmission delays, while yielding a plethora of relevant environmental conditions.

The main function of SPIs as protease enzymes is to regulate the proteolytic activity. In plants, most of the studies of SPIs have been focused on their physiological role. The initial studies carried out in plants showed that SPIs participate in the regulation of endogenous proteolytic processes, as the regulation of proteases in seeds. Besides, it was observed that SPIs also participate in the regulation of cell death during plant development and senescence. On the other hand, plant SPIs have an important role in plant defense against pests and phytopathogenic microorganisms. In the last 20 years, several transgenic plants over-expressing SPIs have been produced and tested in order to achieve the increase of the resistance against pathogenic insects. Finally, in molecular farming, SPIs have been employed to minimize the proteolysis of recombinant proteins expressed in plants.

Currently, almost the entire territory of the country is subject to varying degrees of degradation. The intensity of the desertification processes in different natural zones is influenced by both natural climatic and anthropogenic factors. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of desertification on environmental and socio-economic living conditions, as well as on living standards of the local population. In this work, for the first time, the socio-economic aspects of desertification have been studied on a common methodological basis in different Mongolian aimags over a ten-year period. In order to carry out in-depth research, we used the submeridional and sublatitudinal principles for selecting the model study areas, as well as specific criteria and expert assessment. We used a sociological survey as the main method, based on a designed questionnaire, which was translated into Mongolian. The questionnaire includes questions regarding the influence of desertification on traditional nomadic farming, health of family members, water supply of households, water quality, living standards, etc. The results of the sociological surveys made it possible to draw conclusions on the impact of desertification on households, to identify the main problems of local people, and to describe the dynamics of the socio-economic status of the population living in the model areas. Our studies have demonstrated the intensification of the impact of desertification processes in different natural zones, administrative-territorial units and settlement systems in Mongolia.

The adaptation of farming to the effects of global climate change may lead to the maximization of agricultural production, which is an important and desirable improvement. The main aim of this paper is to rank and quantify the impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector of Cyprus, through a multi-round Delphi survey seeking a consensus agreement in a group of experts. A multidisciplinary group of 20 experts stated their willingness-to-pay for various impacts of climate change. By applying this method, the individual impacts of climate change on crop production and water resources were brought into the modeling effort on equal footing with cost values. The final cost impact estimate represents the total estimated cost of climate change in the agricultural sector. According to the results, this cost reaches EUR 25.08 million annually for the agricultural sector, and EUR 366.48 million for the whole country. Therefore, it is expected that in the seven-year programming period 2014–2020 the total cost of climate change on agriculture ranges from EUR 176 to EUR 2565 million. The most significant impacts are due to the increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere and the burden of biodiversity and ecosystems.

In the research literature, how best to integrate and align effective measures for tackling diffuse pollution, within the context of the EU’s multilevel governance structure, remains an open question. This paper focuses on the first and second implementation cycles of the WFD to explore how national governance arrangements either facilitated or hindered the adoption of effective policies, especially with regards to the delivery of agricultural and water policies on the ground. It draws on data collected through systematic document analysis and interviews with key experts, policymakers and interest groups, and presents a comparative analysis of two case studies: England and Scotland. The case studies show that Scotland’s joined-up governance structure, which enabled policymakers and interest groups to work together and to build trust and cooperation, facilitated the adoption of stricter measures for tackling diffuse pollution. In contrast, in England institutional fragmentation prevented a meaningful engagement of all parties and acted as a barrier. The analysis unpacks the design of policy mixes and the conditions that allow national governments to pursue more holistic and integrated governance approaches to overcome opposition from interest groups and gain their support.

The relationship between the maize producing regions, the maize type, as well as the mycotoxins was established. A total of 123 maize samples was analyzed by a LC-MS/MS multi-mycotoxin method. The results revealed that all maize types exhibited a mixture of free, masked, and emerging mycotoxins contamination across the regions with an average of 5 and up to 24 out of 42 investigated Fusarium mycotoxins, including 1 to 3 masked forms at the same time. Data obtained show that fumonisin B1, B2, B3, B4, and A1 were the most prevalent mycotoxins and had maximum contamination levels of 8908, 3383, 990, 1014, and 51.5 µg/kg, respectively. Deoxynivalenol occurred in 50% of the samples with a mean concentration of 152 µg/kg (max 1380 µg/kg). Thirty-three percent of the samples were contaminated with zearalenone at a mean concentration of 13.6 µg/kg (max 146 µg/kg). Of the masked mycotoxins, DON-3-glucoside occurred at a high incidence level of 53%. Among emerging toxins, moniliformin, fusarinolic acid, and beauvericin showed high occurrences at 98%, 98%, and 83%, and had maximum contamination levels of 1130, 3422, and 142 µg/kg, respectively. Significant differences in the contamination pattern were observed between the agricultural regions and maize types.

CSA is an important approach to promote local economic growth and contribute to sustainable agriculture. Although CSA is widely accepted across the United States, the total number of CSA membership is still very low. It is important to determine the factors that affect the future development of CSA because of its social and environmental benefits. In this study, we analyze how the motivation, barriers, and methods of advertisement influence the participation dynamics of CSA by segmenting consumers based on their past, current, and future CSA participation. Based on a national survey with 795 responses, the results show that the younger generation, high-income families, and people who support sustainable agriculture are more likely to renew their CSA subscription. CSA members are found to be very sensitive to the time of food distribution, the price of products, and the location of CSA farms. Moreover, the impacts of perceived barriers of CSA participation and advertisement method vary based on respondents’ membership status. This paper sheds light on factors that influence various consumer groups and offers a more dynamic analysis of CSA consumer behavior. This analysis enhances understanding of CSA members’ preferences and could help CSA programs expand in the future and to better promote local food systems and sustainable agriculture.

This paper aims to (1) identify the “triggers” for novelty production in UA; (2) characterize the different kinds of novelties applied in UA; (3) evaluate the “innovativeness” of those social, environmental and economic novelties; and, (4) estimate the links between novelties and sustainability. The study was based on the evaluation of 11 case studies in four Western European countries (Italy, Germany, France and Spain). The results show that the trigger and origin of new activities can often be traced back to specific problems that initiators were intended to address or solve. In total, we found 147 novelties produced in the 11 case studies. More novelties are produced in the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability than in the economic. In most cases, external stakeholders played an important role in supporting the projects. The analysis further suggests that innovativeness enhances the overall sustainability in urban agriculture projects.

This study aimed to analyse the influence of these factors and their interactions to determine the emissions by evaluating the environmental cost expressed as the kg of CO2 emitted per kg of production in each of the crops and seasons studied. For this purpose, a field trial was conducted on a farm in Seville (Spain). The study compared Conservation Agriculture, including its three principles (no-tillage, permanent soil cover, and crop rotations), with conventional tillage. Carbon dioxide emissions measured across the four seasons of the experiment showed an increase strongly influenced by rainfall during the vegetative period, in both soil management systems. The results of this study confirm that extreme events of precipitation away from the normal means, result in episodes of high CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. This is very important because one of the consequences for future scenarios of climate change is precisely the increase of extreme episodes of precipitation and periods extremely dry, depending on the area considered. The total of emission values of the different plots of the study show how the soils under the conventional system (tillage) have been emitting 67% more than soils under the conventional agriculture system during the 2010/11 campaign and 25% for the last campaign where the most appreciable differences are observed.

Recently, there have been many artificial neural network (ANN) methods used in agricultural classification tasks, which are task specific and require big datasets. These two characteristics are quite different from how humans learn intelligently. Undoubtedly, it would be exciting if the models can accumulate knowledge to handle continual tasks. Towards this goal, we propose an ANN-based continual classification method via memory storage and retrieval, with two clear advantages: Few data and high flexibility. This proposed ANN-based model combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and generative adversarial network (GAN). Through learning of the similarity between input paired data, the CNN part only requires few raw data to achieve a good performance, suitable for a classification task. The GAN part is used to extract important information from old tasks and generate abstracted images as memory for the future task. Experimental results show that the regular CNN model performs poorly on the continual tasks (pest and plant classification), due to the forgetting problem. However, our proposed method can distinguish all the categories from new and old tasks with good performance, owing to its ability of accumulating knowledge and alleviating forgetting. There are so many possible applications of this proposed approach in the agricultural field, for instance, the intelligent fruit picking robots, which can recognize and pick different kinds of fruits; the plant protection is achieved by automatic identification of diseases and pests, which can continuously improve the detection range. Thus, this work also provides a reference for other studies towards more intelligent and flexible applications in agriculture.

The manual measurement, which is a common practice is an error-prone and time-consuming process. The irregular fields make it even more difficult to calculate the work area. An automatic solution that uses smart technology and algorithms to precisely calculate the work area is crucial for the advancement of agriculture. In this work, we have developed a smart system that utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) that records the movement of agriculture machinery and use it to measure the precise work area of its usage. The system couples the nearest neighbourhood algorithms with Contact-based mechanisms to find the precise work area for different shaped fields and activities. The system was able to record the movement of machinery and calculate its work area, regardless of how many times the machinery runs through a particular field. Our evaluation shows that the system was able to precisely find the work boundaries and calculate the area with a maximum of 9% error for irregular shapes.

Although the sector is one of the most advanced and intense agricultural production systems worldwide, it faces challenges, such as climate change and environmental and social unsustainability of industrial production. To overcome these challenges, alternative food production initiatives have emerged, especially in large cities such as Amsterdam. Some initiatives involve producing food in the urban environment, supported by new technologies and practices, so-called high-tech urban agriculture (HTUA). These initiatives make cultivation of plants inside and on top of buildings possible and increase green spaces in urban areas. The emerging agricultural technologies are creating new business environments that are shape d by technology developers (e.g., suppliers of horticultural light emitting diodes (LED) and control environment systems) and developers of alternative food production practices (e.g., HTUA start-ups). However, research shows that the uptake of these technological innovations in urban planning processes is problematic. Therefore, this research analyzes the barriers that local government planners and HTUA developers are facing in the embedding of HTUA in urban planning processes, using the city of Amsterdam as a case study. This study draws on actor-network theory (ANT) to analyze the interactions between planners, technologies, technology developers and developers of alternative food production practices. Several concepts of ANT are integrated into a multi-level perspective on sustainability transitions (MLP) to create a new theoretical framework that can explain how interactions between technologies and planning actors transform the incumbent social–technical regime. The configuration of interactions between social and material entities in technology development and adoption processes in Amsterdam is analyzed through the lens of this theoretical framework. The data in this study were gathered by tracing actors and their connections by using ethnographic research methods. In the course of the integration of new technologies into urban planning practices, gaps between technologies, technology developers, and planning actors have been identified. The results of this study show a lacking connection between planning actors and technology developers, although planning actors do interact with developers of alternative food production practices. These interactions are influenced by agency of artefacts such as visualizations of the future projects. The paper concludes that for the utilization of emerging technologies for sustainability transition of cities, the existing gap between technology developers and planning actors needs to be bridged through the integration of technology development visions in urban agendas and planning processes.

The surface temperature of plants changes rapidly under stress conditions, which makes thermal RS a useful tool for real-time detection of plant stress conditions. Current applications of UAV thermal RS include monitoring plant water stress, detecting plant diseases, assessing crop yield estimation, and plant phenotyping. However, the correct use and interpretation of thermal data are based on basic knowledge of the nature of thermal radiation. Therefore, aspects that are related to calibration and ground data collection, in which the use of reference panels is highly recommended, as well as data processing, must be carefully considered. This paper aims to review the state of the art of UAV thermal RS in agriculture, outlining an overview of the latest applications and providing a future research outlook.

Many papers argue that sustainable agriculture is necessary, and analyze how this goal could be achieved. At the same time, studies question the sustainability of agriculture. Several obstacles, including theoretical, methodological, personal, and practical issues, hinder or slow down implementation, resulting in the so-called implementation gap. This study addresses potential obstacles that limit the implementation of sustainable agriculture in practice. To overcome the obstacles and to improve implementation, different solutions and actions are required. This study aims to illustrate ways of minimizing or removing obstacles and how to overcome the implementation gap. Unfortunately, the diversity of obstacles and their complexity mean there are no quick and easy solutions. A broader approach that addresses different dimensions and stakeholders is required. Areas of action include institutionalization, assessment and system development, education and capacity building, and social and political support. To realize the suggestions and recommendations and to improve implementation, transdisciplinary work and cooperation between many actors are required.

To achieve this objective, a reliable and updated description of the local status of crops is required. Remote sensing, and in particular satellite-based imagery, proved to be a valuable tool in crop mapping, monitoring, and diseases assessment. However, freely available satellite imagery with low or moderate resolutions showed some limits in specific agricultural applications, e.g., where crops are grown by rows. Indeed, in this framework, the satellite’s output could be biased by intra-row covering, giving inaccurate information about crop status. This paper presents a novel satellite imagery refinement framework, based on a deep learning technique which exploits information properly derived from high resolution images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) airborne multispectral sensors. To train the convolutional neural network, only a single UAV-driven dataset is required, making the proposed approach simple and cost-effective. A vineyard in Serralunga d’Alba (Northern Italy) was chosen as a case study for validation purposes. Refined satellite-driven normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps, acquired in four different periods during the vine growing season, were shown to better describe crop status with respect to raw datasets by correlation analysis and ANOVA. In addition, using a K-means based classifier, 3-class vineyard vigor maps were profitably derived from the NDVI maps, which are a valuable tool for growers.

In the area of agriculture production, IoT-based WSN has been used to observe the yields condition and automate agriculture precision using various sensors. These sensors are deployed in the agricultural environment to improve production yields through intelligent farming decisions and obtain information regarding crops, plants, temperature measurement, humidity, and irrigation systems. However, sensors have limited resources concerning processing, energy, transmitting, and memory capabilities that can negatively impact agriculture production. Besides efficiency, the protection and security of these IoT-based agricultural sensors are also important from malicious adversaries. In this article, we proposed an IoT-based WSN framework as an application to smart agriculture comprising different design levels. Firstly, agricultural sensors capture relevant data and determine a set of cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. Additionally, the strength of the signals on the transmission links is measured while using signal to noise ratio (SNR) to achieve consistent and efficient data transmissions. Secondly, security is provided for data transmission from agricultural sensors towards base stations (BS) while using the recurrence of the linear congruential generator. The simulated results proved that the proposed framework significantly enhanced the communication performance as an average of 13.5% in the network throughput, 38.5% in the packets drop ratio, 13.5% in the network latency, 16% in the energy consumption, and 26% in the routing overheads for smart agriculture, as compared to other solutions.

However, no tangible and systematic evidence exists on how this agriculture would participate in alleviating impacts on vulnerable rural communities. This paper provides a narrative systematic review (SR) integrated with a bibliometric analysis and a concept network analysis to determine how, in this changing climate, sustainable agriculture can increase the resilience of agrosystems. Our search ranged from the date of the first relevant article until the end of 2018. The results generated demonstrated the following: (a) Only single practices and methods have been studied to assess the impacts on single ecosystem services; (b) Soil quality and health are considered a key indicator of sustainable agriculture; (c) Although the assessed practices and methods were shown to improve the biodiversity of agrosystems, which makes them more resilient to extreme climate events, we are still far from developing interdisciplinary and multidimensional agriculture that integrates all management aspects and generates a full range of ecosystem services. In conclusion, this study addressed the following recommendations for the scientific community and policymakers to orient future research strategies and efforts: (a) The integration of all agrosystem services into sustainable management using an ecosystem-based approach on a life-cycle basis using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method; (b) Improving the scientific understanding of traditional knowledge to facilitate greater synergy and further integration; (c) The unification of assessment methods and indicators for the quantification of impacts; (d) The creation of a platform to share, monitor, screen, and approve assessments and evaluations of sustainable agriculture by region.

As a result of the occurring changes in agriculture itself and in its environment, the importance of small agricultural holdings is permanently declining. The gradual disappearance of small family farms not only disrupts the direct relationships between food producers and consumers, but also puts food security at risk, primarily on a local and regional scale. The purpose of the article is an attempt to present that the development of Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) can offer an alternative to the occurring current distribution channels. The article is focused on the possibilities of CSA development in the Wrocław district resulting from the proximity of the largest market in the Lower Silesia region—Wrocław (the capital of Lower Silesia in Poland). The survey covered 400 agricultural holdings located in nine municipalities of the Wrocław district. The conducted research has shown that the CSA model opens opportunities for a long-lasting cooperation between farmers and consumers, but its implementation requires an increase in the prices of agricultural products offered by farmers by about 50%, as well as solutions to the cost-related problems of agricultural product transport.

In particular, the integration of a 7 DOFs (degrees of freedom) manipulator and a mobile frame results in a reconfigurable workspace, which opens to samples collection and inspection in non-structured environments. Moreover, Agri.q mounts an orientable landing platform for drones which is made of solar panels, enabling multi-robot strategies and solar power storage, with a view to sustainable energy. In fact, the device will assume a central role in a more complex automated system for agriculture, that includes the use of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and UGV for coordinated field monitoring and servicing. The electronics of the device is also discussed, since Agri.q should be ready to send-receive data to move autonomously or to be remotely controlled by means of dedicated processing units and transmitter-receiver modules.

This research presents a comprehensive study on the determination of P supplying capacity in this region of Vietnam to examine the possibility of reducing P fertilizer input. In total, 120 soil samples were collected to evaluate total P and Bray 1 available P in the soils. Phosphorus maximum sorption, degree of P saturation, P release, and the effect of P fertilizer on corn (Zea mays L.) yield in greenhouses and fields were also determined. Total P concentrations in 57% of the soil samples evaluated yielded high P concentrations (>560 mg P/kg), while 74% of the samples had high Bray 1 available P concentrations (>20 mg P/kg soil). Maximum P sorption ranged from 149 to 555 mg P/kg soil, respectively, and had negative correlation with available P (r = −0.63*). The percentages of P saturation ranged from 0.63% to 5.5% and correlated with available P (r = 0.98**). Maximum P release ranged from 1.2 to 62 mg P/kg soil, respectively, and correlated with available P (r = 0.96**). Corn grown in soils with available P concentrations >15 mg P/kg did not respond to P fertilizer in greenhouse or field experiments. We conclude that many farmers in this region can reduce P fertilizer input, thus increasing their profits and reducing negative environmental impacts associated with excess soil P for sustainable agriculture.

Anchored by a partnership with the Fundación para la Investigación Participativa con Agricultores de Honduras (FIPAH) and the Yorito Municipal Health Centre, a cross-sectional household survey was administered in Yorito, Honduras, in July 2014. The study population included 1263 individuals from 248 households across 22 rural communities. A multivariate mixed effects negative binomial regression model was built to investigate the relationship between the self-reported number of months without food availability and access from subsistence agriculture in the previous year (August 2013–July 2014) and demographic, socioeconomic, and agricultural production variables. This study found a lengthier ‘lean season’ among surveyed household than previously documented in Honduras. Overall, 62.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): [59.52, 64.87]) of individuals experienced at least four months of insufficient food in the previous year. Individuals from poorer and larger households were more likely to experience insufficient food compared to individuals from wealthier and smaller households. Additionally, individuals from households that produced both maize and beans were less likely to have insufficient food compared to individuals from households that did not grow these staple crops (prevalence ratio (PR) = 0.83; 95% CI: [0.69, 0.99]). Receiving remittances from a migrant family member did not significantly reduce the prevalence of having insufficient food. As unpredictable crop yields linked to climate change and extreme weather events are projected to negatively influence the food security and nutrition outcomes of rural populations, it is important to understand how demographic, socioeconomic, and agricultural production factors may modify the ability of individuals and households engaged in small-scale subsistence agriculture to respond to adverse shocks.

Our findings indicated that the agriculture activities developed through two crucial stages: high and low rise stages. Low rise stages occurred during three sub-stages from April 1987 to April 1988, from September 1993 to August 1998, and from April 2008 to May 2015, with overall change rates of 37.9, 44.4, and 30.5 km2/year, respectively. High rise stages occurred during three sub-stages from April 1988 to February 1993, from September 2000 to March 2006, and from April 2016 to August 2017, with overall change rates of 132.4, 159.1, and 119.5 km2/year, respectively. Different environmental problems due to uncontrolled agriculture activities were observed in the area, including substantial depletion of the groundwater table.

Consequently, VIs originally developed for traditional airborne and spaceborne sensors have become applicable to UAV systems. In this study, we investigated the difference in tillage treatments for cotton and sorghum using various RGB and NIR VIs. Minimized tillage has been known to increase farm sustainability and potentially optimize productivity over time; however, repeated tillage is the most commonly-adopted management practice in agriculture. To this day, quantitative comparisons of plant growth patterns between conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) fields are often inconsistent. In this study, high-resolution and multi-temporal UAV data were used for the analysis of tillage effects on plant health and the performance of various vegetation indices investigated. Time series data over ten dates were acquired on a weekly basis by RGB and multispectral (MS) UAV platforms: a DJI Phantom 4 Pro and a DJI Matrice 100 with the SlantRange 3p sensor. Ground reflectance panels and an ambient illumination sensor were used for the radiometric calibration of RGB and MS orthomosaic images, respectively. Various RGB and NIR-based vegetation indices were then calculated for the comparison between CT and NT treatments. In addition, a one-tailed Z-test was conducted to check the significance of VIs’ difference between CT and NT treatments. The results showed distinct differences in VIs between tillage treatments during the whole growing season. NIR-based VIs showed better discrimination performance than RGB-based VIs. Out of 13 VIs, the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) showed better performance in terms of quantitative difference measurements and the Z-test between tillage treatments. The modified green red vegetation index (MGRVI) and excess green (ExG) showed reliable separability and can be an alternative for economic RGB UAV application.

Rapid and continuous monitoring of environmental and crop parameters may be used to develop mathematical models to predict crop response to microclimatic changes. Here, we applied the energy cascade model (MEC) on green- and red-leaf butterhead lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata). We tooled up the model to describe the changing leaf functional efficiency during the growing period. We validated the model on an independent dataset with two different vapor pressure deficit (VPD) levels, corresponding to nominal (low VPD) and off-nominal (high VPD) conditions. Under low VPD, the modified model accurately predicted the transpiration rate (RMSE = 0.10 Lm−2), edible biomass (RMSE = 6.87 g m−2), net-photosynthesis (rBIAS = 34%), and stomatal conductance (rBIAS = 39%). Under high VPD, the model overestimated photosynthesis and stomatal conductance (rBIAS = 76–68%). This inconsistency is likely due to the empirical nature of the original model, which was designed for nominal conditions. Here, applications of the modified model are discussed, and possible improvements are suggested based on plant morpho-physiological changes occurring in sub-optimal scenarios.

This study was carried out in the Tabuleiro de Russas irrigated perimeter, in northeast Brazil, over the drought period of 2012–2018. Two analyses were conducted: (i) drought characterization, using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based on drought duration and frequency criteria; and (ii) analysis of farmers’ perceptions of drought via selection of explanatory variables using the Random Forest (RF) and the Decision Tree (DT) methods. The 2012–2018 drought period was defined as a meteorological phenomenon by local farmers; however, an SPI evaluation indicated that the drought was of a hydrological nature. According to the RF analysis, four of the nine study variables were more statistically important than the others in influencing farmers’ perception of drought: number of cultivated land plots, farmer’s age, years of experience in the agriculture sector, and education level. These results were confirmed using DT analysis. Understanding the relationship between these variables and farmers’ perception of drought could aid in the development of an adaptation strategy to water deficit scenarios. Farmers’ perception can be beneficial in reducing conflicts, adopting proactive management practices, and developing a holistic and efficient early warning drought system.

Based on the review, biobased plastic nets made from polyamino acids, polysaccharide derivatives (DS), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polycaprolactone (PCL), polyhydroxylalkanoate (PHA), and polylactic acid (PLA) are shown to be highly biodegradable compared to conventional plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride. The biodegradability of these materials is due to the use of natural precursors. However, nonbiodegradable plastics are the materials of choice in agricultural applications for the following reasons. Global commercial production of biobased plastics is low (~1%) due to the absence of facile and scalable production methods. Even though biobased materials are ecologically benign, they are limited in agricultural settings, given the low tensile strength and disruption of the activities of natural insect predators such as spiders. The enhancement of the material properties of biobased plastics involves a trade-off with sustainability. Chemical additives such as heavy metals and volatile compounds enhance the mechanical properties of biobased plastics but limit their sustainability. The current constraints on the production of biobased plastic nets can be resolved through electrospinning techniques that facilitate the development of plastic nets with controllable composition, porosity, and surface areas.

The aim of this research was to assess the effects of native hayseed mixtures on plant and microarthropod communities in an agricultural area of Northern Italy. Three different experimental treatments were set up. The first was a control (C) (i.e., non-seeded plots left to spontaneous vegetation succession after ploughing no deeper than 15 cm). The second, hayseed seeded (Hs) after ploughing no deeper than 15 cm. The third experimental treatment was hayseed overseeded (Ov) on the resident plant community after only a superficial harrowing. Ov plots exhibited the preeminent positive effects on the total productivity and quality of the grassland in terms of total vegetation cover, cover and richness of typical grassland species (i.e., Molinio-Arrhenatheretea species), and cover of legumes, grasses and perennial species. Moreover, Ov sites exhibited the highest abundance of microarthropod taxa and soil biological quality (QBS-ar) but only in spring, when the disturbance of ploughing negatively affected Hs and C plots. On the other hand, Hs sites showed a great reduction of invasive alien (i.e., Ambrosia artemisiifolia and Artemisia verlotiorum) and segetal weed species (i.e., Capsella bursa-pastoris and Spergula arvensis) in terms of cover. This study provides valuable indication on using hayseed mixtures to create grassland habitats as reservoir of native flora and soil biodiversity in agriculture areas.

Access to electricity in the rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa is only 28%, roughly 600 million people. The financing of rural electrification is challenging and, in order to accomplish higher private sector investments, new innovative business models have to be developed. In this paper, a new approach in the financing of microgrid electrification activities is proposed and investigated. In this approach, agriculture related businesses take the lead in the electrification activities of the surrounding communities. It is shown that the high cost of rural electrification can be met through the increased value of locally produced products, and cross-subsidization can take place in order to decrease the cost of household electrification. The approach is implemented in a case study in Rwanda, through which the possibility of local agricultural cooperatives leading electrification activities is demonstrated.

This aspect is even more evident in industrial agriculture, which is based on the use of multiple chemical products derived from non-natural synthesis. In more developed countries, a new idea of ecology linked to agricultural production has been increasingly developed and, for this reason, there has been a greater diffusion of differentiated agricultural models taking into consideration the environmental impact of production choices and policies addressed to the conservation of natural resources. In urban agricultural production, it is even more important to adopt resilient production models that, in addition to developing responsible production paths and allowing a positive connection with the needs of consumers, guarantees reasonable and positive behaviors respecting the environment in which most of the urban population lives; in other words, the implementation of goal 12 of the sustainable development goals (SDG #12 Responsible Production and Consumption) of the United Nations. In this work, we report some case studies inspired by the activities carried out by the Slow Food Association in Africa and demonstrate the importance of agroecological models in small-scale agricultural systems, related to the development of school and community gardens in small urban areas of different African countries, as a tool for integrating agricultural activities aimed at social resilience and the conservation of ecosystems.

It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the ’Proefcentrum Hoogstraten’ research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design.

Irrigation water use, soil moisture, and agronomic data were monitored, and laboratory testing was conducted for soil samples, which were collected from 0 to 40 cm depth before planting and after harvest during the study period of 2015–2017. Calculation of crop coefficient (Kc) revealed a significant decrease in Kc values under CA as compared to CT. The result depicted that CA with a drip irrigation system significantly (α = 0.05) reduced Kc values of crops as compared to CT. Specifically, 20% reductions were observed for onion, cabbage, and garlic under CA whereas 10% reductions were observed for pepper throughout the crop base period. Consequently, irrigation water measurement showed that about 18% to 28% of a significant irrigation water savings were observed for the range of vegetables under CA as compared to CT. On the other hand, the results of soil measurement showed the CA practice significantly (α = 0.05) increased soil moisture (4%, 7%, 8%, and 10% increment for onion, cabbage, garlic, pepper) than CT practice even if irrigation input was small in CA practice. In addition, CA was found to improve the soil physico-chemical properties with significant improvement on organic matter (10%), field capacity (4%), and total nitrogen (10%) in the Dangishta experimental site. CA with drip irrigation is evidenced to be an efficient water-saving technology while improving soil properties to support sustainable intensification in the region.

Several methods were used to compile the national inventory, in particular the questionnaire survey method. The Czech part of the research was based on 30 questionnaires conducted among both farmers and agricultural organizations engaged in demonstration activities. The questions were focused on a specialization in agriculture, type of the management, connections with networks and their size, types of demonstration activities according to the types of farms and non-productive activities. The most common topics and purposes for demonstration in the Czech Republic are recorded for the category arable land with combined crops. Highly linked to sustainability are activities such as conservation agriculture on arable land with combined crops, root crops and fodders mainly due to a reduction of soil erosion within crop production and animal health management and welfare for dairy within livestock production. The Ministry of Agriculture has prepared a subsidy program to help farmers in the form of illustrative practical demonstrations of comprehensive sustainable farming practices. The main added values for the end-users, if the generated knowledge is implemented, are to strengthen the knowledge transfer system in agriculture, focusing on practical demonstrations and presentation of sustainable farming systems and soil protection in practice.

This study seeks to understand alternatives to tobacco production from the perspective of government officials, extension officers, and farmers at the sub-national level (Migori, Busia, and Meru) in Kenya. The study analyzes data from qualitative key-informant interviews with government officials and extension officers (n = 9) and focus group discussions (FGDs) with farmers (n = 5). Data were coded according to pre-identified categories derived from the research aim, namely, opportunities and challenges of tobacco farming and alternative crops, as well findings that illustrate the policy environment that shapes the agricultural context in these regions. We highlight important factors associated with the production of non-tobacco agricultural commodities, including the factors that shape the ability of these non-agricultural commodities to serve as viable alternatives to tobacco. The results highlight the effect that several factors, including access to capital, markets, and governmental assistance, have on farmer decisions. The results additionally display the structured policy approaches that are being promoted in governmental offices towards agricultural production, as well as the institutional shortcomings that inhibit their implementation at the sub-national level.

We used the water footprint theory to quantify the spatiotemporal characteristics and variation in the water footprint of agriculture and livestock (WF-AL) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region of China (2000–2016). We predicted the spatial distribution and sustainability of regional water resources at different levels of annual precipitation. Results showed that the average county WF-AL rose from 8.03 × 108 m3 in 2000 to 10.89 × 108 m3 in 2016. There was spatial heterogeneity compared to the average city WF-AL. The WF-AL varied between the mountains and the plains. The scale of the WF-AL was one of the main reasons for differences in the consumption and distribution of water resources. The development of regional water resources deteriorated from a stable state to an unstable state from 2000 to 2016. Only 5.8% of the areas maintained a stable state of water resources. Even in the predicted wet years, no improvements were found in the instability of water resources in four areas centered on the counties of Xinji, Daming, Luannan, and Weichang. To achieve a medium and long-term balance between WF-AL development and water resource recovery, the WF-AL should be limited and combined with reservoir and cross-regional water transfer.

This concept is directly related to bioeconomy. Spain implemented its own strategy in bioeconomy in 2016, affecting all economic activities, agriculture included. In line with this, one of the most important agricultural sectors is the greenhouse horticulture of Almería (SE Spain). This region has experienced deep changes in the last 40 years, and has become one of the most efficient agro-industrial complexes in the world. This rapid growth has brought sustainability problems such as pollution, water overuse, or inadequate waste management. Several studies have undertaken organic waste reuse or minimization, but an important lack of knowledge exists regarding the inorganic fraction. One of the goals of the REINWASTE project is to find solutions for this problem. Therefore, an extensive legal framework has been consulted and an in-depth study of the steps in greenhouse production with the associated residues has been carried out.

Humic acid (HA) and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are among the most effective methods that utilize natural biologically-active substances. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of the presence of HA on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) inoculation with PGPR (Bacillus megatorium and Bacillus subtilis) when compared to control and recommended doses of NPK. Seed tubers treated by humic acid (200, 400, and 600 kg ha−1) and PGPR, separately or in combination, and NPK (50% and 100%) were planted into soil and untreated soil. Treatments were assessed for plant growth, classified tuber yields, quality, and mineral contents of potato tubers. There were highly significant increases in potato growth, tuber yields, and quality in PGPR and HA inoculated crops. Tuber size, weight, specific gravity, dry matter, starch, protein, and mineral contents (except Cu) were improved with PGPR treatments and further increased when administered with humic acids. Inoculation with PGPR mixed culture and 400 kg ha−1 HA increased total potato tuber yield by about 140% while conventional single treatment of 100% NPK fertilizer only led to an increase in potato production of 111% when compared to the control. The results demonstrated that this integrated approach has the potential to accelerate the transformation from conventional to sustainable potato production.

CSA aims at producing and providing environmentally, socially, economically, and nutritionally sustainable food. Past research has focused on CSA members’ motivations. This research aims to gain a better understanding of CSA farmers’ perceived benefits and drawbacks in managing a CSA farm, and whether CSA management perception varies in different countries. The research collected data from 35 farmers that were based in the United States (US) and Hungary (HU). Data elaboration includes a one-way Anova test, Chi-square test, principal component analysis, and multiple multivariate linear regressions. The results support that US and HU farmers have similar positive perceptions of CSA farming management, especially in food quality, nutritional value products, environmental, and community benefits. The main differences concentrate on economic, financial, and management perceptions. CSA success as an alternative agro-food production and distribution system relies on the capability to involve CSA members. Therefore, CSA farmers’ management skills may evolve to ensure the performance of communication and community engaging practices.

Green manures are known as a good alternative to the use of mineral fertilizers and pesticides. They are an important source of nitrogen and reduce significantly weed invasion. Nevertheless, the literature providing a precise quantification of total nutrients available for plants after incorporation of leguminous species cultivated in Portugal is scarce. This lake of knowledge’s makes farmers worried about hypothetic productivity loss, making them to use excessive complementary amounts of mineral fertilizer. Providing farmers with tools to calculated accurately the reduction of mineral fertilizer will increase their gain and avoid environmental pollution by nutrients lixiviation. Under the scope the international H2020 SoilCare project, a study was conducted during the winter and spring of 2018–2019 at Baixo Mondego valley in Central Portugal, where the main land use is the monoculture of irrigated corn. The nutrient uptake was determined for 5 species of legumes: pre-inoculated Pea (Pisum sativum L.); Yellow Lupin (Lupinus luteus), Red Clover (Trifolium pratense); Balansa Clover (Trifolium michelianum); Arrowleaf Clover (Trifolium vesiculosum) and a control (natural vegetation). For each treatment, we determined total dry matter yield for leguminous and weeds, macronutrients uptake (N and P Total, K, Na, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients uptake (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn). Combining soil analyses, theoretical main crop needs in nutrients (short cycle grain maize) and mineralization rates, we calculated the precise amendment needed to obtain the expected yield of maize in what concerns the macronutrient. The production of total dry matter (leguminous and weeds) was very similar for the 5 treatments e.g., about 7 ton/ha. Nevertheless, considering leguminous production, the higher dry matter yields was obtain for the Arrowleaf Clover and the lower for the Red Clover respectively 5.5 and 3.5 ton/ha. The Macronutrient content (N,P,K) of the leguminous ranged between 22.9 and 28.0 g/kg for N, 2.4 and 3.1 g/kg for P and 12.1 and 31.5 g/kg for K. The Yellow Lupin presented the higher values of N, the clovers the higher values of P and K. The total quantity of macronutrients incorporated in the soil was in average 152 kg/ha for N, 20 kg/ha for P and 170 kg/ha for K with the higher quantities for Arrowleaf Clover. We considered a mineralization coefficient of 0.5 for N and 0.6 for P during the first year and a nutrient extraction of 280 kg/ha of N, 50 kg/ha of P and 245 kg/ha of K, for a production yield of 12 t/ha of corn grain.

Agricultural intensification has been economically beneficial to NZ but has implications for its clean green image. Contaminated waterways, high carbon emissions, and extensive soil erosion demonstrate the downside of high stocking rates and land clearing. Transformative farming systems are required to address the challenge of balancing production with the environment. Whilst navigating through the process of change, farmers need to be supported to make informed decisions at the farm and landscape scale. Landscape ecology (LE) is ideally positioned to inform the development of future farming landscapes and provide a scientific context to the criteria against which land-related information can be evaluated. However, to do this effectively, LE needs to demonstrate that it can link theory with practice. Using NZ as a case example, this paper discusses the key roles for LE in future farming systems. It looks at the way LE can help quantify the state of the landscape, provide support towards the co-creation of alternative futures, and assist with the inclusion of land-related information into design and planning to ensure mitigation and adaption responses assist in the transformation of farming systems for sustainable outcomes.

The significance and relevance of SIPs in a Pakistani context demands an investigation. Hence, this study takes the initiative to investigate the determinants regarding the adoption of these practices. Based on the evidence, we selected five SIPs, namely, improved seeds, organic manure, crop rotation, intercropping, and low tillage. Furthermore, this study analyzes the adoption of SIPs with randomly collected data from 612 farmers through multistage sampling. A multivariate probit model (MVP) is employed to analyze the mutually dependent adoption decisions and identify the factors associated with them. The results revealed that education, the area under cultivation, access to information, extension access, social participation, rainfall variability, and temperature increase significantly predict the adoption of SIPs. The adoption of organic manure and crop rotation was highest between all the ecological zones, whereas low tillage was the least adopted practice. Adoption intensity in mixed cropping zones was slightly higher than the other ecological zones. Moreover, the findings also reveal the important synergies amid natural resource management and input-based SIPs. Hence, the study highlights the perseverance and importance of social groups and recommends the government to formulate comprehensive policies to facilitate institutional access and elevate the adoption level amongst the farming community.

Therefore, it is very important to develop secure authentication and key agreement for the system. Recently, Ali et al. proposed an authentication and key agreement scheme using WSNs for agriculture monitoring. However, it fails to provide user untraceability, user anonymity, and session key security; it suffers from sensor node impersonation attack and perfect forward secrecy attack; and even worse has denial of service as a service.

Participants were asked about their access to information technologies, information sources via social network ties, level of engagement in the local community, and agricultural input use. Results indicate households with higher levels of information access through cell phone use and weak-tie information sources are more likely to use inputs. Significant findings also include the interactional effect of cell phones and weak ties on fertilizer adoption.

We present data on the current performance of agricultural production areas in these islands and discuss them in terms of their most important natural constraint, water. Also, we assess the impact of institutional strategies on crop production and evaluate recent mechanisms that have been engaged towards agrarian development in this archipelago. Our results show that, among the ten Cabo Verde Islands, Santiago has the largest area used for agriculture (52.5%), followed by Santo Antão (16%) and Fogo (15.8%), and that rainfed farming dominates in all of them. The staple crops, such as maize and beans, are produced through rainfed subsistence farming, whereas irrigated crops (i.e., sugarcane, tomatoes) are mostly grown for commercial purposes. The prolonged drought periods, exposure, erosion and soil degradation, which led to increasing desertification over the last decades, have been identified as the main constraints to agrarian development across the ten islands of the archipelago.

We argue that they should be treated as integrated components of a single complex system that is prone to direct or indirect tradeoffs that should be avoided while also being amenable to synergies that should be sought. Direct tradeoffs such as competition for space or the pollution of shared water resources usually occur when the footprints of agriculture and aquaculture overlap or when the two practices coexist in close proximity to one another. Interactions can be modulated by factors such as hydropower infrastructure and short-term economic incentives, both of which are known to disrupt the balance between aquaculture and agriculture. Indirect tradeoffs, on the other hand, play out across distances, i.e., when agricultural food sources are diverted to feed animals in aquaculture. Synergies are associated with the culture of aquatic organisms in rice paddies and irrigation waters, seasonal rotations of crop cultivation with aquaculture, and various forms of integrated agriculture–aquaculture (IAA), including jitang, a highly developed variant of pond-dike IAA. Policy decisions, socioeconomic considerations, and technology warrant increased scrutiny as determinants of tradeoffs and synergies. Priority issues for the future include guiding the expansion of aquaculture from its traditional base in Asia, taking advantage of the heterogeneity that exists within both agricultural and aquaculture systems, the development of additional metrics of tradeoffs and synergies, and adapting to the effects of climate change.

The index for the analysis and measurement of economic resilience is based on four areas: financial flexibility, stability in following the development path, diversification of activities, and diversification of export markets. As results show, Austrian agriculture is of interest because of the very high level of economic resilience, ranging from 0.83 to 0.92 in the period researched, thereby displaying a high capacity to absorb shocks. Generally, these results indicate that Austrian agriculture is forgiving of shocks and thus very economically resilient. These results provide context for developing generalizations on economic resilience in agriculture and its fundamental function for producing effective food security within a sustainable transition path. Some concluding suggestions propose possible future areas of research. View Full-Text',\n"," 'Agriculture provides for the most basic needs of humankind: food and fiber. The introduction of new farming techniques in the past century (e.g., during the Green Revolution) has helped agriculture keep pace with growing demands for food and other agricultural products. However, further increases in food demand, a growing population, and rising income levels are likely to put additional strain on natural resources. With growing recognition of the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, new techniques and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture. Emerging technologies, such as geospatial technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI), could be utilized to make informed management decisions aimed to increase crop production. Precision agriculture (PA) entails the application of a suite of such technologies to optimize agricultural inputs to increase agricultural production and reduce input losses. Use of remote sensing technologies for PA has increased rapidly during the past few decades. The unprecedented availability of high resolution (spatial, spectral and temporal) satellite images has promoted the use of remote sensing in many PA applications, including crop monitoring, irrigation management, nutrient application, disease and pest management, and yield prediction. In this paper, we provide an overview of remote sensing systems, techniques, and vegetation indices along with their recent (2015–2020) applications in PA. Remote-sensing-based PA technologies such as variable fertilizer rate application technology in Green Seeker and Crop Circle have already been incorporated in commercial agriculture. Use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased tremendously during the last decade due to their cost-effectiveness and flexibility in obtaining the high-resolution (cm-scale) images needed for PA applications. At the same time, the availability of a large amount of satellite data has prompted researchers to explore advanced data storage and processing techniques such as cloud computing and machine learning. Given the complexity of image processing and the amount of technical knowledge and expertise needed, it is critical to explore and develop a simple yet reliable workflow for the real-time application of remote sensing in PA. Development of accurate yet easy to use, user-friendly systems is likely to result in broader adoption of remote sensing technologies in commercial and non-commercial PA applications.

This paper provides a comprehensive analysis and discussion of climate change impacts on water and agriculture sectors and implications for the attainment of developmental outcomes such as food security, poverty reduction, and sustainable development in Southern Africa. The review gives policy messages for coping, adapting, and building resilience of water and agricultural production systems in the face of projected changes in climate and variability. The aim is to guide the region towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Future projections for Southern Africa indicate reduced rainfall, increased temperatures, and high variability for the greater part of the region with severe reductions on the drier and marginal western parts. These impacts have profound implications for agriculture performance and contribution to national and regional developmental goals. The region is projected to experience reductions of between 15% and 50% in agricultural productivity, a scenario that would exacerbate food insecurity in the region. The challenge is to increase productivity on current arable land through efficient and sustainable management of available water and energy, and at the same time reducing pressure on the environment. Affordability and accessibility of innovative adaptation measures on water resources remain critical and these strategies should be part of broader sustainable development efforts. Overall, efforts to enhance agricultural productivity need to emphasise investments in sustainable management and use of water and energy resources in agriculture to achieve sustainable economic growth and livelihoods.

Such projects aim to cope with the challenge of sustainable urban development and today the sustainability of the projects is questioned. To date, no set of criteria has been designed to specifically assess the environmental, social and economic sustainability of these farms at the farm scale. Our study aims to identify sustainability objectives and criteria applicable to professional intra-urban farms. It relies on a participatory approach involving various stakeholders of the French urban agriculture sector comprising an initial focus group, online surveys and interviews. We obtained a set of six objectives related to environmental impacts, link to the city, economic and ethical meaning, food and environmental education, consumer/producer connection and socio-territorial services. In addition, 21 criteria split between agro-environmental, socio-territorial and economic dimensions were identified to reach these objectives. Overall, agro-environmental and socio-territorial criteria were assessed as more important than economic criteria, whereas food production was not mentioned. Differences were identified between urban farmers and decision makers, highlighting that decision makers were more focused on projects’ external sustainability. They also pay attention to the urban farmer agricultural background, suggesting that they rely on urban farmers to ensure the internal sustainability of the farm. Based on our results, indicators could be designed to measure the sustainability criteria identified, and to allow the sustainability assessment of intra-urban farms.

In this study, the solution developed addresses countries characterised by relatively small farms, vast spatial and temporal variability and severe data scarcity. The proposed model-based approach is directly relevant to the evaluation of agricultural policies affecting water abstraction based on multisource data. The evaluation process utilises an entirely spatially distributed, continuous hydrological model. The model provides a gridded output of the main hydrological balance components, as well as vegetation water deficit and irrigation water requirements, on a daily temporal step on a country scale. It provides information at the farm level and facilitates the estimation of water abstractions in agriculture, taking into consideration all the pertinent information included in the Integrated Administration and Control System database that is maintained by RDPs in Europe. Remote sensing data also are used to validate crop patterns. The obtained results were analysed to estimate the net effect of the RDP to the reduction of water abstractions in agriculture. This work produces valuable information concerning the evaluation of agricultural policies and the assessment of land use, and climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.

We use CO2 emissions from the agriculture sector as a proxy indicator for environmental quality. We employ various unit root tests (e.g., ADF, PP, ERS, KPSS) and structural break unit root tests (Z&A, CMR) to check the stationarity and structural break in the data series. Cointegration tests, i.e., Johansen, Engle-Granger, and ARDL cointegration approaches are used to ensure their robustness. Results showed that significant long-term cointegration exists among the variables. Findings also indicated that an increase in financial development and foreign direct investment (FDI) improves environmental quality, whereas the increase in economic growth and electricity consumption in the agriculture sector degrades environmental quality in Pakistan. Based on the findings, we suggest policymakers should provide a conducive environment for foreign investment. Moreover, it is also suggested that a reliance on fossil fuels be reduced and a transition to renewable energy sources be encouraged to decrease the environmental pollution in the country.

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) is a unique local food channel adopted by producers that was initially established as a strategy for producers to directly benefit from the season-long investments of buyers who align with their community-focused mission. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture has long collected data to improve farm performance, information on specific marketing channels is missing, and in response, this research provides some of the first evidence of the heterogeneity of performance among CSAs. In a pilot approach to understanding the economics of CSAs relative to other direct marketing channels, we conducted an assessment process, incorporating 42 farms in Colorado between June 2016 and October 2017. Results showed that farms that incorporated CSA sales in their direct market portfolios tended to be smaller in scale and utilize more diverse markets. Although these CSA farms have lower average weekly sales, they have the highest average marketing profit margins compared to other direct market channels.

To maximise the multifunctionality of these farms, entrepreneurial or innovative farm diversification is important. However, there is insufficient research on this issue in developed countries. This study aims to demonstrate the existence of advanced diversified farms characterised by entrepreneurship, skilled farm management and social networks and explore their economic and social sustainability by using data from a survey of 386 farms located close to urban areas in Japan. Gaussian mixture clustering analysis revealed that only about 10% of the sample can be classified as advanced diversified farms and most of the other diversified farms do not exhibit entrepreneurial attributes. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed that advanced diversification has a positive impact not only on the economic viability of farms, but also on their social performance. These findings have significant implications for policies promoting the sustainability of urban agriculture, suggesting that a more balanced promotion of the diversification and entrepreneurial attributes of farms is crucial to building a sustainable relationship between cities and urban agriculture.

Agriculture in these regions is threatened by increases in the occurrence of drought and high temperature events associated with climate change (CC). In this review we analyze what would be the effects of CC on crops (including orchards and vineyards), how crops and cropping and farming systems could adapt to CC, and what are the social and economic impacts, as well as the strategies used by producers to adapt to CC. In rainfed areas, water deficit occurs mostly during the flowering and grain filling stages (terminal drought stress), which has large detrimental effects on the productivity of crops. Orchards and vineyards, which are mostly cultivated in irrigated areas, will also be vulnerable to water deficit due to a reduction in water available for irrigation and an increase in evapotranspiration. Adaptation of agriculture to CC in MCRs requires integrated strategies that encompass different levels of organization: the crop (including orchards and vineyards), the cropping system (sequence of crops and management techniques used on a particular agricultural field) and the farming system, which includes the farmer.

However, the increased production cost of planting green manure reduces farmers’ willingness to adopt this approach, which is unfavorable for its sustainability. This research aims to investigate the influence of instrumental variables on farmers’ perceptions of sustainable agriculture practices, especially the use of rotation fallow, and tries to understand the relationship between farmers’ perceptions of using rotation fallow and planting green manure under incentive measures adopted by local authorities in Guangxi Province, China. Using simultaneous equation models, the results show that subsidies and planting training were the most important drivers for restoring green manure planting in the target region. These incentive measures could be further enhanced as a priority to restore green manure planting. The study also finds that socioeconomic factors such as farmer’s income, area of farmland, and labor for agricultural production have a certain influence on planting green manure planting and on farmers’ perceptions of using rotation fallow as a form of sustainable agriculture practice.

This work aimed at assessing the interrelation between EWE and agriculture through a systematic quantitative review of current scientific literature. The review analysed 19 major cropping systems (cereals, legumes, viticulture, horticulture and pastures) across five continents. Documents were extracted from the Scopus database and examined with a text mining tool to appraise the trend of publications across the years, the specific EWE-related issues examined and the research gaps addressed. The results highlighted that food security and economic losses due to the EWE represent a major interest of the scientific community. Implementation of remote sensing and imagery techniques for monitoring and detecting the effects of EWE is still underdeveloped. Large research gaps still lie in the areas concerning the effects of EWE on major cash crops (grapevine and tomato) and the agronomic dynamics of EWE in developing countries. Current knowledge on the physiological dynamics regulating the responses of main crops to EWE appears to be well established, while more research is urgently needed in the fields of mitigation measures and governance systems.

This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of IoT applications in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure and key technologies. Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research and deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the contributions made by different academicians and organizations. Selected references were clustered into three application domains corresponding to plant management, animal farming and food/agricultural product supply traceability. Furthermore, we discussed the challenges along with future research prospects, to help new researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.

These actions aim to promote the integration of renewables and the reduction of emissions in all sectors. Among the different sectors, agriculture emerges as a remarkable opportunity to integrate these proposals. Indeed, this sector accounts for 10% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU, representing 1.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016. Within the agriculture sector, current solutions for groundwater pumping purposes are mainly based on diesel technologies, leading to a remarkable fossil fuel dependence and emissions that must be reduced to fulfill both energy and environmental requirements. Relevant actions must be proposed that are focused on sustainable strategies and initiatives. Under this scenario, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into groundwater pumping installations has recently been considered as a suitable solution. However, this approach requires a more extended analysis, including different risks and impacts related to sustainability from the economic and energy points of view, and by considering other relevant aspects such as environmental consequences. In addition, PV solar power systems connected to the grid for groundwater pumping purposes provide a relevant opportunity to optimize the power supplied by these installations in terms of self-consumption and net-metering advantages. Actually, the excess PV power might be injected to the grid, with potential profits and benefits for the agriculture sector. Under this scenario, the present paper gives a multidimensional analysis of PV solar power systems connected to the grid for groundwater pumping solutions, including net-metering conditions and benefit estimations that are focused on a Spanish case study. Extensive results based on a real aquifer (Aquifer 23) located in Castilla La Mancha (Spain) are included and discussed in detail.

Although several attempts have been made to evaluate urban agriculture production, few studies have investigated food production in a multitemporal geospatial way and considered per capita population needs, gender, and age strata consumption. This study presents a spatiotemporal quantification of urban agriculture in the city of Milan (Italy) for assessing food self-provisioning potential. We utilized high-resolution Google Earth images and ancillary data to create a detailed cadaster of urban agriculture for the years 2007 and 2014. Based on four scenarios of food production and statistical data on vegetables and cereals consumption, we estimated current total production and requirements for the city dwellers. Our results showed that the actual extension of vegetable gardens (98 ha) and arable land (2539 ha) in the best scenario could satisfy approximately 63,700 and 321,000 consumers of vegetables and cereal products, respectively. Overall, current urban agriculture production is not able to meet vegetables and cereal consumption for more than 1.3 million city residents. Scenario estimates suggest rethinking land use promoting horticultural production to achieve more sustainable food systems.

In this paper, we advanced and demonstrated the practical use and application of a mobile smartphone-based tool, i.e., the Open Data Kit (ODK), to assemble and keep track of real-time maize (Zea mays L.) phenological data in three SSA countries. Farmers, extension agents, researchers, and other stakeholders were enlisted to participate in an initiative to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphone-based apps and open-source servers for rapid data collection and management. A pre-installed maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants (n = 75) for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in 2015–2017. The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date, date of emergence, date of first flowering, anthesis, grain filling, and maturity. Results showed that in Ethiopia, early maturing varieties took 105 days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes, whereas late-maturing varieties took up to 190 days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas. In Tanzania, a similar trend was observed, whereas in Nigeria, most existing varieties took an average of 100 days to complete their developmental stages. Furthermore, the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence, emergence to flowering, flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature. The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety, which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development. The data aggregation approach using the ODK and on-farm personnel improved efficiency and convenience in data collection and visualization. Our study demonstrates that this system can be used in crop management and research on many spatial scales, i.e., local, regional, and continental, with relatively high data collation accuracy.

Among PBCs, Miscanthus grasses with C4 photosynthesis combine high yield potentials and water use efficiencies. However, the standard commercial clone M. x giganteus (Mxg), with minimal stomatal regulation, is too sensitive to drought for reliable yields in the Mediterranean regions. This paper screened a diverse panel of thirteen Miscanthus genotypes (M. sinensis, M. floridulus, M. sacchariflorus and Mxg) to identify which types could maximize yield under summer drought conditions typical in the South Mediterranean climate. In the second growing season, significant differences were observed for plant height (from 63 to 185 cm), stem number (from 12 to 208 stems plant−1), biomass yield (from 0.17 to 6.4 kg DM plant−1) and whole crop water use efficiency (from 0.11 to 7.0 g L−1). Temporal variation in net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and instantaneous water use efficiency identified different strategies adopted by genotypes, and that genotypes selected from M. floridulus and M. sinensis were better adapted to rainfed conditions and could produce six times more biomass than the Mxg. These accessions are being used as parents in experimental breeding aimed at producing future seed-based drought resilient hybrids.

This study was carried out to understand the effects of zinc (Zn), boron (B), and molybdenum (Mo) on the growth and yield of lentil, and how these elements can help manage soil fertility issues. In this regard, the morpho-physiological traits of lentils (BARI Masur-7) were collected from two experiments receiving the same treatments carried out during consecutive rabi seasons of 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. The experiments were laid out with a randomized complete block design having eight treatments, and was replicated thrice. The treatments were T1 (Control), T2 (Zn2.0 kg ha−1), T3 (B1.5 kg ha−1), T4 (Mo1.0 kg ha−1), T5 (Zn2.0B1.5 kg ha−1), T6 (Zn2.0Mo1.0 kg ha−1), T7 (B1.5Mo1.0 kg ha−1), and T8 (Zn2.0B1.5Mo1.0 kg ha−1). The results revealed that the application of micronutrients either singly or in combination had significant effects on the plant height, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, thousand seed weight, and the seed yield of lentil. The maximum seed production was, however, observed in plots receiving treatment T8, i.e., the combined application of Zn, B, and Mo. Agronomic biofortification also had significantly increased protein content of lentil seeds while affecting the macro and micronutrient content of lentil seed. These results suggest that any micronutrient deficiencies might lead to a yield loss of lentil, and such a scenario could be avoided by a combined application of micronutrients at a proportionate level.

Such information is a critical input for any site-specific weed management program. A multi-rotor UAS (Phantom 4) equipped with an RGB sensor was used to collect imagery in three bands (Red, Green, and Blue; 0.8 cm/pixel resolution) with the objectives of (a) mapping weeds in cotton and (b) determining the relationship between image-based weed coverage and ground-based weed densities. For weed mapping, three different weed density levels (high, medium, and low) were established for a mix of different weed species, with three replications. To determine weed densities through ground truthing, five quadrats (1 m × 1 m) were laid out in each plot. The aerial imageries were preprocessed and subjected to Hough transformation to delineate cotton rows. Following the separation of inter-row vegetation from crop rows, a multi-level classification coupled with machine learning algorithms were used to distinguish intra-row weeds from cotton. Overall, accuracy levels of 89.16%, 85.83%, and 83.33% and kappa values of 0.84, 0.79, and 0.75 were achieved for detecting weed occurrence in high, medium, and low density plots, respectively. Further, ground-truthing based overall weed density values were fairly correlated (r2 = 0.80) with image-based weed coverage assessments. Among the specific weed species evaluated, Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) showed the highest correlation (r2 = 0.91) followed by red sprangletop (Leptochloa mucronata Michx) (r2 = 0.88).

The purpose of this review is to highlight and summarize eukaryotic virus–bacteria findings in the food/water, horticultural, and animal sciences. In many cases in the agricultural sciences, mechanistic understandings of the effects of virus–bacteria interactions remain unstudied, and many studies solely focus on co-infections of bacterial and viral pathogens. Given recent findings relative to human viral pathogens, further research related to virus–bacteria interactions would likely result in numerous discoveries and beneficial applications.

We evaluated red clover-maize, maize-soybean, and soybean-wheat/red clover rotations in organic and conventional cropping systems with recommended and high inputs in New York, USA to identify the best rotation and management practices during the transition. Organic compared with conventional maize with recommended inputs in the maize-soybean rotation (entry crop) averaged 32% lower yields, $878/ha higher production costs, and $1096/ha lower partial returns. Organic maize compared with conventional maize with recommended inputs in the red clover-maize rotation (second transition crop) had similar yields, production costs, and partial returns. Organic compared with conventional soybean with recommended inputs in soybean-wheat/red clover or maize-soybean rotations had similar yields, production costs, and partial returns. Organic compared with conventional wheat with recommended inputs in the soybean-wheat/clover rotation had similar yields, $416/ha higher production costs, and $491/ha lower partial returns. The organic compared with the conventional soybean-wheat/red clover rotation had the least negative impact on partial returns during the transition. Nevertheless, all organic rotations had similar partial returns ($434 to $495/ha) so transitioning immediately, regardless of entry crop, may be most prudent. High input management did not improve organic crop yields during the transition.

Thus, providing consistent or increased durum grain to the world market is one of the priorities for policy-makers, researchers, and farmers. What are the major achievements in agronomic advancement for durum wheat cultivation in recent decades? How might the current cropping systems be improved to increase crop yield and quality and improve resource use efficiencies while minimizing input costs and decreasing negative impact on the environment? Canada is one of the major durum wheat producers in the world, as Canada contributes about 50% to global trade of durum grain. Canada’s research achievements in durum wheat might serve as a guide for advancing the cultivation of the crop in other regions/countries on the planet. This review summarizes the major Canadian research findings in the aspects of durum wheat agronomics during the period 2001 to 2017 years. It highlights the main advancements in seeding and tillage, crop rotation and diversification, and use of pulse-induced microbiomes to improve soil health and feedback mechanisms. The genetic gain and breeding for resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses are discussed. Finally, we identified the main constraints and suggested some near-term research priorities.

As such, it does not demand the application of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizer and can offer environmental benefits as part of holistic cropping systems. While common bean commodities are highly nutritious, commercial cultivation of this crop is declining in already-industrialized countries. However, recent interest of consumers towards diets that benefit environmental and personal health has rekindled commercial interest in legumes, including the common bean. The aim of this protocol is to identify agronomic practices that are capable of increasing the yield and quality of the common bean for use as food. To address this research question, published literature will be screened for inclusion on the basis of defined eligibility criteria to ensure data sources are selected in an objective and consistent manner.

In this research, the MUlticriteria Satisfaction Analysis (MUSA) method and the related software is used in order to evaluate the users’ satisfaction of agricultural e-Government services. For this reason, we used the results of a survey conducted for an agricultural e-Government web portal in Greece. Five main criteria and the thirty-one sub-criteria were used in order to calculate the global and partial users’ satisfaction. From the results, the strong and the weak points of the agricultural e-Government services and the specific usability attributes that are more crucial for the users’ satisfaction were determined. The results of the questionnaire revealed that the average level of the users’ satisfaction is high but there are still actions to be taken in order to improve the provided agricultural e-Government services. Furthermore, the users of agricultural e-Government services attributed great importance to the criteria of interaction and accessibility. The MUSA method highlights the actions that have to be taken using action and improvement diagrams.

Agronomical and basic fruit quality parameters were also determined. At twelve years after budding, significant differences were found between rootstocks for the different agronomic and fruit quality traits evaluated. The Pollizo plum rootstocks Adesoto and PM 105 AD seem to induce higher sweetness to peach fruits, based on soluble solids content, individual (sucrose, fructose and sorbitol) and total sugars. A clear tendency was also observed with the rootstock Adesoto, inducing the highest content of phenolics, flavonoids, vitamin C and relative antioxidant capacity (RAC). Thus, the results of this study demonstrate the significant effect of rootstock on the sugar profile and phytochemical characteristics of peach fruits. In addition, this work shows the importance of the sugar profile, because specific sugars play an important role in peach flavour quality, as well as the studied phytochemical compounds when looking for high quality peaches with enhanced health properties.

This research developed an automatic image processing technique to detect rice crop height based on images taken by a digital camera attached to a field server. The camera acquires rice paddy images daily at a consistent time of day. The images include the rice plants and a marker bar used to provide a height reference. The rice crop height can be indirectly measured from the images by measuring the height of the marker bar compared to the height of the initial marker bar. Four digital image processing steps are employed to automatically measure the rice crop height: band selection, filtering, thresholding, and height measurement. Band selection is used to remove redundant features. Filtering extracts significant features of the marker bar. The thresholding method is applied to separate objects and boundaries of the marker bar versus other areas. The marker bar is detected and compared with the initial marker bar to measure the rice crop height. Our experiment used a field server with a digital camera to continuously monitor a rice field located in Suphanburi Province, Thailand. The experimental results show that the proposed method measures rice crop height effectively, with no human intervention required.

Here we report a comprehensive analysis of a data set derived from farm-surveys and previously published studies in a typical high N input area of China. Using scenario analysis, farmers from both sources were divided into four rice production levels to assess the YG and NUE of smallholder farmers. Farm surveys showed that rice yield and partial factor productivity of applied N (PFPN) averaged 8273 kg ha−1 and 23.1 kg kg−1 at regional-scale, with a potential increase of 21–43% and 33–52%, respectively. A wide variation in yield and PFPN across different types of farmer was observed. Optimized N management significantly narrowed YGs by 3.7% and PFPN gap by 63.5% on average based on the published literature. Multiple factors, including excessive N rates, small rice planting area (0.33 ha), the aging (51 years old) and low education level (6 years of education) of the major labor force, can partly explain causes of yield and NUE gaps. These findings provide farm-based evidence that centralized management, good agronomy plus advances in knowledge and technologies are essential for future agricultural development.

Foremost is the availability of arable soils, which have been ravaged by the overuse of fertilizers and detrimental soil management techniques. The maintenance of soil quality and reclamation of marginal soils are urgent priorities. The use of biochar, a carbon-rich, porous material thought to improve various soil properties, is gaining interest. Biochar (BC) is produced through the thermochemical decomposition of organic matter in a process known as pyrolysis. Importantly, the source of organic material, or ‘feedstock’, used in this process and different parameters of pyrolysis determine the chemical and physical properties of biochar. The incorporation of BC impacts soil–water relations and soil health, and it has been shown to have an overall positive impact on crop yield; however, pre-existing physical, chemical, and biological soil properties influence the outcome. The effects of long-term field application of BC and how it influences the soil microcosm also need to be understood. This literature review, including a focused meta-analysis, summarizes the key outcomes of BC studies and identifies critical research areas for future investigations. This knowledge will facilitate the predictable enhancement of crop productivity and meaningful carbon sequestration.

In general, the midseason N is applied without consideration of the actual crop N status, which may lead to over-fertilization and associated environmental problems. Thus, the purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a N recommendation approach using aerial images for Mediterranean paddy rice systems. A two-year rice field experiment was established in northeastern Spain, with different rates of pig slurry (PS) and mineral N fertilizer. Multispectral aerial images were taken at the rice booting stage, and several vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated. The VIs showed strong relationships with yield and the relations significantly differed between the PS and mineral fertilization treatments. The strongest relations with yield were obtained with gMCARINIR, proposed in this study, (R2 = 0.67), GNDVI (R2 = 0.64) and MCARINIR (R2 = 0.64), indicating the importance of including the green band information. The N recommendation approach generated using the VIs information showed a high success (87.5%) in the preliminary evaluation. The economic and environmental analysis showed that this approach provides a useful tool when compared to the usual farmer practices.

Located in the central North China Plain, Hengshui City has experienced a regional groundwater depression cone due to excessive pumping of groundwater, resulting in the largest overdraft area in the North China Plain. Since 2014, Hebei Province has adopted measures to realize the comprehensive governance of groundwater overdraft in partial areas of Hengshui City, including adjusting planting structures, promoting agronomic water-saving techniques, strengthening hydraulic engineering construction, and innovative management systems. These measures have been in effect for two years, such that their effectiveness must be assessed for the beneficial recovery of groundwater levels to determine the means for their continuation and extension. However, the change in regional groundwater levels is not gradual, but reflects a process of sudden increase due to the intervention of government behavior, and many existing groundwater recharge models are difficult to apply. Therefore, establishing a reasonable, scientific evaluation system of the measures is a key problem that requires a solution. Using field surveys and experiments, this study establishes a quantitative analysis evaluation method to assess the performance of governance measures adopted by Hengshui City in 2015, with full consideration of the crop water demand process and rainfall frequency. The results show that governance measures had a significant positive outcome on reducing groundwater overdraft in pilot areas. Approximately 98.4% of the agricultural governance target was achieved, with confined groundwater rebounding by approximately 4.92 m as compared to 2015. According to the analysis, the three most efficient measures (the top three largest amounts of groundwater-saved per mu) adopted by the government were (1) non-agricultural crops replacement (forestry), (2) planting pattern adjustments, and (3) integration of water and fertilizer-vegetable, which can be promoted in future measures. However, considering the size of the implementation area and total governance capacity, water-saving during spring irrigation of wheat and replacement by surface water are the two most important conservation measures, which are required to further strengthen the management and implementation effect.

Field experiments were performed in Vitis vinifera L. vines to study the effect of the previously described stomata-closing compound (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate (HB). Exogenous treatments at different doses were periodically carried out using a randomized block design. Firstly, we observed that HB was able to induce stomatal closure in grapevine plants. Under field conditions, the application of HB around veraison induced a higher color intensity in berries, and vines treated at higher doses reached this stage earlier than the un-treated controls. There was also a clear increase in both grape anthocyanin concentration and total soluble solids without having a negative impact on total yield. We therefore, confirm the role of HB as a universal natural stomatal closure compound and propose a new use for HB in viticulture as a ripening inducer, by accelerating anthocyanin accumulation.

To identify the DNA segment that codes for early maturity, a tetraploid potato segregation population of “Zhongshu 19” × “Zhongshu 3” was genetically analyzed, using a combination of high throughput simplified genome sequencing (2b-RAD) and bulked segregant analysis (BSA). The DNA segment related to the early-maturity trait was identified at the 3.7~4.2 Mb locus on the short arm of chromosome 5. Eight molecular markers were developed, of which five were closely linked to the early-maturity trait loci. Additionally, 42 simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers were constructed based on the reference sequence of Solanum tuberosum group Phureja DM1-3 516 R44 (DM). Using the TetraploidMap software, the linkage map of chromosome 5 was constructed with 50 markers. The total map length was 172 centiMorgan (cM), with an average genetic distance of 3.44 cM. Correlating molecular and phenotypic data of the segregating population, the mapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 5 contributed to 33.55% of the early-maturity phenotype. The early-maturity QTL was located at 84 cM, flanked by the SSR5-85-1 and SCAR5-8 markers. The QTL was fine-mapped to 471 kb. Using DNA sequence annotation, 34 genes were identified in this region, 12 of them with unknown function. Among the other 22 annotated genes, E3 ubiquitin ligase gene PUB14 could be related to maturity and regulation of tuber formation. The constructed QTL map is a useful basic tool for the cloning of early-maturity related genes in tetraploid potatoes.

The main keywords included in research publications concerning these crops were also analysed globally and clustered in thematic groups. In the case of keywords related to agronomy or genetics and molecular biology, we considered documents dated up to 1999, and from 2000 to 2018, separately.

However, optimal P rates vary substantially when different targets such as maximum yield or maximum economic benefit are considered. The present study used field experiment conducted at 36 experiments sites for maize to determine the impact of P application levels on grain yield, plant P uptake, and P agronomy efficiency (AEP), P-derived yield benefits and private profitability, and to evaluated the agronomically (AOPR), privately (POPR), and economically (EOPR) optimal P rate at a regional scale. Four treatments were compared: No P fertilizer (P0); P rate of 45–60 kg ha−1 (LP); P rate of 90–120 kg ha−1 (MP); P rate of 135–180 kg ha−1 (HP). P application more effectively increased grain yield, reaching a peak at MP treatment. The plant P uptake in HP treatment was 37.4% higher than that in P0. The relationship between P uptake by plants (y) and P application rate (x) can be described by the equation y = −0.0003x2 + 0.1266x + 31.1 (R2 = 0.309, p < 0.01). Furthermore, grain yield (y) and plant P uptake (x) across all treatments also showed a significant polynomial function (R2 = 0.787–0.846). The MP treatment led to highest improvements in P agronomic efficiency (AEP), P-derived yield benefits (BY) and private profitability (BP) compared with those in other treatments. In addition, the average agronomically (AOPR), privately (POPR), and economically optimal P rate (EOPR) in 36 experimental sites were suggested as 127.9 kg ha−1, 110.8 kg ha−1, and 114.4 kg ha−1, which ranged from 80.6 to 211.3 kg ha−1, 78.2 to 181.8 kg ha−1, and 82.6 to 151.6 kg ha−1, respectively. Economically optimal P application (EOPR) can be recommended, because EOPR significantly reduced P application compared with AOPR, and average economically optimal yield was slightly higher compared with the average yield in the MP treatment. This study was conducive in providing a more productive, use-effective, profitable, environment-friendly P fertilizer management strategy for supporting maximized production potential and environment sustainable development.

In particular in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), these issues require urgent attention. This is clearly stated in The United Nations Global Goals for Sustainable Development emphasizing the importance of sustainable use of land resources to increase food productivity and energy requirement. SSA lags behind most regions of the world in household food security and access to energy. The rural agriculture-dependent communities of SSA are the hardest hit by food and energy scarcity and the impact is felt most by communities in the dryland farming areas. In terms of energy supply appropriate measures and interventions are required to address this challenge. Jatropha curcas L. oil fast tracked itself from obscurity to prominence. Its main advantage is the high content of methyl ester (or bio-diesel). It conforms to EN 14214 specifications, exhibiting emission reduction potential and qualifying as a lucrative bio-diesel alternative to fossil diesel. This paper proposes a focus on Jatropha technology as a holistic approach to tackling the land, energy and food degradation challenges in unison for dry-land SSA. The new Jatropha strategy would be innovative and environmentally friendly soil resource recapitalization and supply feed stock for rural energy generation while fulfilling the criteria of delivering other benefits, such as addressing land use conflict for food and energy production',\n"," 'Water-saving irrigation development level (WIDL) refers to reasonably and accurately judging a water-saving area based on the analysis of all factors affecting the water-saving irrigation development. The evaluation of regional WIDL is the premise of scientific planning guidance to irrigation work. How to select reasonable evaluation indexes and build a scientific and comprehensive model to evaluate WIDL is of great significance. In this study, the comprehensive evaluation index system of WIDL in 21 cities (states) of the Sichuan province in China (a typical humid region in southern China) was constructed, and the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) method was improved to evaluate WIDL. Results showed that the overall development level of water-saving irrigation was “poor” in Sichuan province. The water-saving irrigation level turned out to be “good” in three regions with advantageous geographical conditions and developed economies, “general” in four regions with good economic levels where agronomy water saving has been popularized, and “poor” in fourteen regions of mountainous and hilly areas, especially Ganzi, Aba, and Liangshan, located in the Northwest plateau of Sichuan province, with poor natural resources and insufficient economies. The evaluation results were in good agreement with the actual situation, and in this area, there is enormous potential for the development of water-saving irrigation strategies.

The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of varying plant spacings (2.0 m × 4 m compared to 1.5 m × 4 m), crop establishment methods (raising plantlets in a nursery prior to planting to the field compared to direct sowing) and genotypes on seed yield, seed quality and plant height, recorded at a dry-subhumid location in Madagascar (Ihosy) and at a humid location in Cameroon (Batchenga). Averaged across treatment variants and genotypes, seed yield and seed oil content were higher at the dry-subhumid site and in particular the narrower spacing reached higher seed yields per unit area than the wider spacing. At the humid site, plant growth was characterized by strong accumulation of biomass. The establishment method tested at the dry-subhumid site showed no significant differences in the recorded parameters. Our results encourage to re-think common practices in jatropha cultivation and underpin the importance of the correct choice of location, genotype and agronomic practices considering the interactions between all factors.

In the present study, we investigated the individual and combined effect of drought and heat stress on growth, photosynthesis, oxidative damage, and gene expression in A. sieberi alba. Drought and heat stress triggered oxidative damage by increasing the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, and therefore electrolyte leakage. The accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as phenol and flavonoids, and proline, mannitol, inositol, and sorbitol, was increased due to drought and heat stress exposure. Photosynthetic attributes including chlorophyll synthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were drastically reduced due to drought and heat stress exposure. Relative water content declined significantly in stressed plants, which was evident by the reduced leaf water potential and the water use efficiency, therefore, affecting the overall growth performance. Relative expression of aquaporin (AQP), dehydrin (DHN1), late embryogenesis abundant (LEA), osmotin (OSM-34), and heat shock proteins (HSP70) were significantly higher in stressed plants. Drought triggered the expression of AQP, DHN1, LEA, and OSM-34 more than heat, which improved the HSP70 transcript levels. A. sieberi alba responded to drought and heat stress by initiating key physio-biochemical and molecular responses, which were distinct in plants exposed to a combination of drought and heat stress.

We use agronomic crop production, water withdrawal, and energy consumption data to estimate groundwater withdrawal from electric-powered irrigation wells and examine agronomic productivity in Iran’s 31 provinces through the lens of GEF nexus. The ex-post GEF analysis sheds light on some of the root causes of the nation’s worsening water shortage problems. Access to highly subsidized water (surface water and groundwater) and energy has been the backbone of agricultural expansion policies in Iran, supporting employment in agrarian communities. Consequently, water use for agronomic crop production has greatly overshot the renewable water supply capacity of the country, making water bankruptcy a serious national security threat. Significant groundwater table decline across the country and increasing energy consumption underscore dysfunctional feedback relations between agricultural water and energy price and groundwater withdrawal in an inefficient agronomic sector. Thus, it is essential to implement holistic policy reforms aimed at reducing agricultural water consumption to alleviate the looming water bankruptcy threats, which can lead to the loss of numerous agricultural jobs in the years to come.

The accuracy of characterizing SWC has been tested primarily on a small-scale and has received little attention from the scientific community at the field scale. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the characterization of the spatial distribution of soil water content at the field scale by the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). In evaluating the current aim, ECa survey was compared against repeated measurements of SWC at five depths using neutron probe. Results showed that mean SWC was different across ECa derived management zones, which indicates that on a macro-scale, soil ECa could effectively characterize the mean differences in SWC across management zones. Results also showed that deep ECa (0–150 cm) survey outperformed shallow survey (0–75 cm). Considering other soil properties, such as organic matter content and salt content, further improved the relationship between SWC and ECa.

However, information on the genetic control of yield-related traits is still limited. In this study, we aimed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for canopy temperature and chlorophyll content index during anthesis (CTa and CCIa, respectively), the mid grain-filling stage (CTg1 and CCIg1, respectively), and the late grain-filling stage (CTg2 and CCIg2, respectively) as well as for plant height (PH), thousand kernels weight (TKW), and grain yield (GY) using genome-wide linkage mapping. To this end, a double haploid population derived from a cross between two high yielding wheat cultivars, UI Platinum and SY Capstone, was phenotyped in four irrigated environments and genotyped using the wheat 90K iSelect platform and simple sequence repeats. The genotypic data were used to construct a high-density genetic map of 43 linkage groups (LGs) with a total length of 3594.0 cm and a marker density of 0.37 cm. A total of 116 QTL for all nine traits was detected on 33 LGs, spreading to all wheat chromosomes, except for Chr. 7D. Of these, six QTL (CTa.ui-4B.1, Q.CTg1.ui-5B-2.1, Q.CTg2.ui-6B.1, Q.PH.ui-6A-2.1, Q.TKW.ui-2D-1, and Q.GY.ui-6B) were consistently detected in more than three irrigated environments, called as stable QTL. Additionally, we identified 26 QTL clusters for more than two traits, of which the top four were located on Chromosomes 4A-1, 1B-1, 5B-2, and 2D-1. Overall, the stable QTL significantly related with grain yield, QTL clusters, and linked molecular markers identified in this study, may be useful in marker-assisted selection in early generation and early growth stage for grain yield improvement.

It is becoming feasible to use modern sensors and data analysis techniques for predicting plant growth and productivity based on genomic, phenotypic, and environmental data. To design and construct crops that deliver desired traits requires trained personnel with scientific and engineering expertise as well as a variety of “soft” skills. To address these needs at Iowa State University, we developed a graduate specialization called “Predictive Plant Phenomics” (P3). Although some of our experiences may be unique, many of the specialization’s principles are likely to be broadly applicable to others interested in developing graduate training programs in plant phenomics. P3 involves transdisciplinary training and activities designed to develop communication, teambuilding, and management skills. To support students in this demanding and unique intellectual environment, we established a two-week boot camp before their first semester and founded a community of practice to support students throughout their graduate careers.

The traits were: biomass yield per plant; C, N, and ash concentrations; leaf and culm sap sucrose concentrations; percentage seed set, and the number of caryopses per panicle. In 2013, the biomass yield averaged 0.21 ± 0.09 kg per plant (mean ± the standard deviation). In 2014 to 2017, the yield averaged from 3.9 ± 0.8 kg per plant to 7.5 ± 1.8 kg per plant. Carbon concentration was generally higher than other energy crops, while N and ash concentrations were generally lower. Leaf sap sucrose ranged from 24.4 ± 4.6 g kg−1 in 2016 to 41.6 ± 7.6 g kg−1 in 2013. Culm sap sucrose varied from approximately 1.6 to 2.1 times that of leaf sap depending upon the harvest year.

In most farmers’ fields in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), there is low availability of N in the soil mainly due to continuous cultivation of the land, crop residues removal, little or no application of fertilizers and rapid leaching. There is a need to develop low N tolerant and adapted maize genotypes. Evaluation of maize genotypes under different nitrogen conditions would therefore be useful in identifying genotypes that combine stability with high yield potential for both stress and non-stress environment. Eighty maize hybrids were evaluated at Mbalmayo and Nkolbisson in Cameroon, during 2012 and 2013 minor and major cropping seasons across 11 environments under low and high N conditions. The objectives of the study were: (i) to determine the effect of genotype x environment interaction (G × E) on grain yield and yield stability of single cross maize hybrids across low N and optimum N environments and (ii) to identify genotypes to recommend for further use in the breeding program. Yield data of 80 hybrids were analyzed initially and the analysis of 20 best performing genotypes was further performed for a better visualization and interpretation of the results. Combined analysis of variance showed highly significant G × E effects for grain yield. The GGE biplot analysis divided the study area into three mega environments: one related to the major cropping season while the two others were related to the minor cropping season. The grain yield of the 20 highest yielding hybrids ranged from 4484.7 to 5198.3 kg ha−1. Hybrid 1368 × 87036 was the highest yielding in the minor season while the most outstanding hybrid, TL-11-A-1642-5 × 87036 was the best for the major season. The latter hybrid showed the potential for production across environments and should therefore be further tested in multiple environments to confirm consistency of its high yield performance and stability, and to facilitate its release as a commercial hybrid. High yielding but not stable hybrids across environments could be recommended for the specific environments where they performed well.

Legumes play an important role in cropping systems, by associating with rhizobia microbes that convert plant-unavailable atmospheric nitrogen into usable nitrogen through symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF). However, there can be field-level spatial variability for SNF activity, as well as underlying soil factors that influence SNF (e.g., macro/micronutrients, pH, and rhizobia). There is a need for PA tools that can diagnose spatial variability in SNF activity, as well as the relevant environmental factors that influence SNF. Little information is available in the literature concerning the potential of PA to diagnose/optimize SNF. Here, we critically analyze SNF/soil diagnostic methods that hold promise as PA tools in the short–medium term. We also review the challenges facing additional diagnostics currently used for research, and describe the innovations needed to move them forward as PA tools. Our analysis suggests that the nitrogen difference method, isotope methods, and proximal and remote sensing techniques hold promise for diagnosing field-level variability in SNF. With respect to soil diagnostics, soil sensors and remote sensing techniques for nitrogen, phosphorus, pH, and salinity have short–medium term potential to optimize legume SNF under field conditions.

One possibility is to exploit this type of information obtained from early stages of the growing season by combining it with genomic data. This opens an avenue that can be capitalized by improving the predictive ability of the common prediction models used for genomic prediction. Imagery (canopy coverage) data recorded between days 14–71 using two collection methods (ground information in 2013 and 2014; aerial information in 2014 and 2015) on a soybean nested association mapping population (SoyNAM) was used to calibrate the prediction models together with the inclusion of several types of interactions between canopy coverage data, environments, and genomic data. Three different scenarios were considered that breeders might face testing lines in fields: (i) incomplete field trials (CV2); (ii) newly developed lines (CV1); and (iii) predicting lines in unobserved environments (CV0). Two different traits were evaluated in this study: yield and days to maturity (DTM). Results showed improvements in the predictive ability for yield with respect to those models that solely included genomic data. These relative improvements ranged 27–123%, 27–148%, and 65–165% for CV2, CV1, and CV0, respectively. No major changes were observed for DTM. Similar improvements were observed for both traits when the reduced canopy information for days 14–33 was used to build the training-testing relationships, showing a clear advantage of using phenomics in very early stages of the growing season.

Optimality criteria and a search algorithm were implemented to generate randomized complete block (RCB), incomplete block (IB), augmented block (AB) and unequally replicated (UR) designs. Several conditions were evaluated including size of the experiment, levels of heritability, and optimality criteria. For RCB designs with half-sib or full-sib families, the optimization procedure yielded important improvements under the presence of mild to strong spatial correlation levels and relatively low heritability values. Also, for these designs, improvements in terms of overall design efficiency (ODE%) reached values of up to 8.7%, but these gains varied depending on the evaluated conditions. In general, for all evaluated designs, higher ODE% values were achieved from genetically unrelated individuals compared to experiments with half-sib and full-sib families. As expected, accuracy of prediction of genetic values improved as levels of heritability and spatial correlations increased. This study has demonstrated that important improvements in design efficiency and prediction accuracies can be achieved by optimizing how the levels of a treatment are assigned to the experimental units.

This phenomenon minimizes the agronomic efficiency of N, P and K fertilizers and consequently result in a dwindling economic benefit associated with their use. Therefore, 18 on-farm trials were conducted in western Kenya during two cropping seasons to assess maize response to three NPK amendments; (i) N, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu (inorganic and organic); (ii) N, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu (inorganic) and (iii) N, P K, Zn and Cu (inorganic) and evaluate the profitability of their use compared to additions of only N, P and K fertilizers. In this set of experiments, maize response to any amendment refers to a yield increase of ≥2 t ha−1 above control and could be categorized in three clusters. Cluster 1, comprising of nine sites, maize responded to all amendments. Cluster 2, holding six sites, maize responded only to one amendment, N, P, K, Ca, Zn and Cu (inorganic). In this cluster, (2), emerging S, Mg and Cu deficiencies may still limit maize production. Cluster 3; consisting of three sites, maize responded poorly to all amendments due to relatively high soil fertility (≥17 mg P kg−1). Profitability of using NPK amendments is limited to Cluster 1 and 2 and the largest Value Cost Ratio (VCR) of 3.1 is attainable only when soil available P is below 4.72 mg kg−1. These variable responses indicate the need for developing site-specific fertilizer recommendations for improved maize production and profitability of fertilizer use in poorly responsive soils.

Single-nucleotide and insertion–deletion (InDel) polymorphisms have been widely used as DNA markers, not only in plant breeding but also to identify various traits in rice. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has produced sequences that allow for genome-wide detection of these molecular markers. These polymorphisms can potentially be used to develop high-accuracy polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based markers. PCR-based techniques are rapid and successful methods to deal with the problem of adulteration at a commercial level. Here, we report the genome-wide analysis of InDel markers of 17 commercially available Chinese cultivars. In order to achieve accurate results, all samples were sequenced at approximately 30× genome coverage using Illumina HiSeq 2500™ system. An average of 10.6 GB clean reads per sample was produced and ~96.3% of the reads could be mapped to the rice genome reference IRGSP 1.0. After a series of filtering, we selected five InDel markers for PCR validation. The results revealed that these InDel markers can be used for authentication of Korean elite cultivars from the adulterants.

Drought yield QTLs (qDTYs; QTLs = quantitative trait loci) were pyramided into MRQ74 and MR219 to produce drought tolerant lines. In this study, new drought tolerant MRQ74 and MR219 pyramided lines (PLs) were evaluated under drought stress (RS) and non-stress (NS) conditions to evaluate the effects of different qDTYs combinations on morphological and agronomical traits. MRQ74 PLs having qDTY12.1 possessed the best root length (RL) under both RS and NS but the effect was only significant for MR219 PLs under RS. Some qDTYs combinations also found to have consistent effect on the same trait of both populations. PLs with only qDTY12.1 showed the highest grain yield (GY) under RS in both populations which means qDTY12.1 controlled RL and caused higher GY under drought condition. The interaction of major-effect qDTY12.1 with qDTY2.2 also shows significant effect on leaf rolling (LR) of both PL populations. These qDTYs proved to be beneficial in improving traits related to drought tolerance. Selected PLs with qDTY12.1 combinations also found to have better RL and root weight (RW) under RS. Improvement of morphological and agronomical traits led to higher GY of PLs. Therefore, qDTY12.1 either is present singly or in combination with other qDTYs was the best qDTY due to its consistent effect on morphological and agronomical traits and GY across populations under RS and NS.

Therefore, an evaluation of irrigation water quality based on only a few crucial parameters, which consider the crop species to be irrigated and the type of irrigation system and management adopted, can be an easy and flexible method for maximizing the reuse of wastewater and low-quality water for agricultural purposes. In this view, an irrigation water quality tool (IWQT) was developed to support farmers of arid and semi-arid regions on evaluating the use of low quality water for crop irrigation. The most significant and cheapest parameters of irrigation water quality were identified and clustered in three quality classes according to their effects on crop yield and soil fertility (agronomic quality indicators), human health (hygiene and health quality indicators), and irrigation systems (management quality indicators). According to IWQT parameters, a tool reporting a series of recommendations, including water treatment types, was implemented to guide farmers on the use of low quality irrigation water.

The present paper reviews some of the most recent achievements in development of QPM varieties using both conventional and molecular breeding under stressed and non-stressed environments. It is evident that numerous QPM varieties have been developed and released around the world over the past few decades. While the review points out some gaps in information or research efforts, challenges associated with adoption QPM varieties are highlighted and suggestions to overcome them are presented. The adoption of released varieties and challenges facing QPM production at the farmer level are also mentioned. Several breeding methods have been conventionally used to develop QPM varieties in stressed (drought, low soil nitrogen, resistance to grey leaf spot, Turcicum leaf blight, ear rot, and Striga) and non-stressed environments. At least three genetic loci have been found to be implicated in controlling the levels of a protein synthesis factor correlated with lysine. They have been mapped on chromosomes 2, 4, and 7. While the use of molecular approaches will improve the efficiency and speed of variety development, the cost implications might limit the use of these technologies in the developing world. More emphasis should be given to breeding QPM for tolerance to environmental stresses, such as low soil pH, heat, and combined heat and drought stress. The post-harvest attack of QPM grains should also be considered. The adoption of QPM genotypes by farmers has been found to be limited mainly due to the minimal collaboration between maize breeders, farmers, agricultural extension workers, and other relevant stakeholders, as well as the need for isolating QPM varieties from normal maize. Therefore, there is need to use participatory plant breeding (PPB) and/or participatory variety selection (PVS) to enhance and improve the adoption of QPM varieties.

In addition, micronutrient application efficiency is fundamental to avoid periods of overconsumption or deficits in the crop. To determine micronutrient accumulation using a dynamic model, two cycles of Vitaly and Luxell cucumber crops were grown. During the development of the crop, micronutrient content (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, and Zn) in the different organs of the cucumber plant was quantified. The model dynamically simulated the accumulation of biomass and micronutrients using climatic variables recorded inside the greenhouse as inputs. It was found that a decrease in photosynthetically active radiation and temperature significantly diminished the accumulation of biomass by the cucumber plants. On the other hand, the results demonstrated that the model efficiently simulated both the accumulation of biomass and micronutrients in a cucumber crop. The efficiency evaluation showed values higher than R2 > 0.95. This dynamic model can be useful to define adequate strategies for the management of cucumber cultivation in greenhouses as well as the application of micronutrients.

Phosphorus is the second most limiting nutrient after nitrogen and has damaging impacts on crop yield if found to be deficient. Therefore, farmers tend to apply more P than is required to satisfy any P loss after its application at planting. Several important questions were raised in this study to improve P efficiency and reduce its pollution. The objective of this study was to find potential reasons for P pollution in water bodies despite a decrease in potato acreage. Historically, the potato was found to be responsible for P water contamination due to its high P sensitivity and low P removal (25–30 kg ha−1) from the soil. Despite University of Maine recommended rate of 56 kg ha−1 P, if soil tests reveal that P is below 50 kg ha−1, growers tend to apply P fertilizer at the rate of 182 kg ha−1 to compensate for any loss. The second key reason for excessive P application is its tendency to get fixed by aluminum (Al) in the soil. Soil sampling data from UMaine Soil Testing Laboratory confirmed that in Maine reactive Al levels have remained high over the last ten years and are increasing further. Likewise, P application to non-responsive sites, soil variability, pH change, and soil testing methods were found to be other possible reasons that might have led to increases in soil P levels resulting in P erosion to water streams.

Arsenic is present in different oxidative states in the environment and enters in the food chain through soil and water. In the agricultural field, irrigation with arsenic contaminated water, that is, having a higher level of arsenic contamination on the top soil, which may affects the quality of crop production. The major crop like rice (Oryza sativa L.) requires a considerable amount of water to complete its lifecycle. Rice plants potentially accumulate arsenic, particularly inorganic arsenic (iAs) from the field, in different body parts including grains. Different transporters have been reported in assisting the accumulation of arsenic in plant cells; for example, arsenate (AsV) is absorbed with the help of phosphate transporters, and arsenite (AsIII) through nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) by the silicon transport pathway and plasma membrane intrinsic protein aquaporins. Researchers and practitioners are trying their level best to mitigate the problem of As contamination in rice. However, the solution strategies vary considerably with various factors, such as cultural practices, soil, water, and environmental/economic conditions, etc. The contemporary work on rice to explain arsenic uptake, transport, and metabolism processes at rhizosphere, may help to formulate better plans. Common agronomical practices like rain water harvesting for crop irrigation, use of natural components that help in arsenic methylation, and biotechnological approaches may explore how to reduce arsenic uptake by food crops. This review will encompass the research advances and practical agronomic strategies on arsenic contamination in rice crop.

The development of A. toschiella-resistant wheat cultivars is a proven economically and ecologically viable method of controlling this pest. This study assessed A. toschiella resistance in wheat genotypes containing the H13, H21, H25, H26, H18 and Hdic genes for resistance to the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) and in 94M370 wheat, which contains the Dn7 gene for resistance to the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov). A. toschiella populations produced on plants containing Dn7 and H21 were significantly lower than those on plants of the susceptible control and no different than those on the resistant control. Dn7 resistance to D. noxia and H21 resistance to M. destructor resulted from translocations of chromatin from rye into wheat (H21—2BS/2RL, Dn7—1BL/1RS). These results provide new wheat pest management information, indicating that Dn7 and H21 constitute resources that can be used to reduce yield losses caused by A. toschiella, M. destructor, D. noxia, and wheat streak mosaic virus infection by transferring multi-pest resistance to single sources of germplasm.

Given that NUEagron (grain yield/total N uptake) is a function of harvest index (HI; grain yield/crop biomass) × crop biomass/total N uptake, and that improving HI is already the target of most breeding programs, and specific improvement in NUEagron can only really be achieved by increasing the crop biomass/N uptake. Since rice crops take up around 80% of total crop N prior to flowering, improving the biomass/N uptake (NUEveg) prior to, or at, flowering may be the best means to improve the NUEagron. Ultimately, however, enhanced NUEagron may come at the expense of grain protein unless the N harvest index increases concurrently. We investigated the relationships between NUEagron, total N uptake, grain yield, grain N concentration (i.e., protein) and N harvest index (NHI) in 16 rice genotypes under optimal N conditions over two seasons to determine if scope exists to improve the NHI and/or grain protein, while maintaining or enhancing NUEagron in rice. Using data from these experiments and from an additional experiment with cv. IR64 under optimum conditions at an experimental farm to establish a benchmark for NUE parameters in high-input, high yielding conditions, we simulated theoretical potential improvements in NUEveg that could be achieved in both low and high-input scenarios by manipulating target NHIs and grain protein levels. Simulations suggested that scope exists to increase grain protein levels in low yielding scenarios with only modest (5–10%) reductions in current NUEagron by increasing the current NHI from 0.6 to 0.8. Furthermore, substantial scope exists to improve NUEveg (and therefore NUEagron) in high-yielding scenarios if maintaining current grain protein levels of 7.3% is not essential.

All the in-field and transport operations are considered, providing a detailed analysis of the energy requirements of the components that contribute to the overall energy consumption. A demonstration scenario is also described. The scenario is based on three selected energy crops, namely Miscanthus, Arundo donax and Switchgrass.

Crop Surface Models (CSMs) representing the absolute height of the plant canopy are a tool for this. In this study, fresh and dry barley biomass per plot are estimated from CSM-derived plot-wise plant heights. The CSMs are generated in a semi-automated manner using Structure-from-Motion (SfM)/Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) software from oblique stereo RGB images. The images were acquired automatedly from consumer grade smart cameras mounted at an elevated position on a lifting hoist. Fresh and dry biomass were measured destructively at four dates each in 2014 and 2015. We used exponential and simple linear regression based on different calibration/validation splits. Coefficients of determination between 0.55 and 0.79 and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 97 and 234 g/m2 are reached for the validation of predicted vs. observed dry biomass, while Willmott’s refined index of model performance ranges between 0.59 and 0.77. For fresh biomass, values between 0.34 and 0.61 are reached, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 312 and 785 g/m2 and between 0.39 and 0.66. We therefore established the possibility of using this novel low-cost system to estimate barley dry biomass over time.

Likewise, in widely used heuristic frameworks, such as the social–ecological system (SES) framework, governance interactions between resources are not sufficiently addressed. We address this gap empirically, using the case of Tajikistan, based on a farm household survey analysis of 306 farmers. The results indicate that land system variables contribute to the willingness to cooperate in irrigation management. Specifically, formal land tenure has a positive effect on farmers paying for water as well as on the likelihood of their investing time and effort in irrigation infrastructure, which is decisive for Tajikistan’s food and fiber production. Irrigation system variables show that, e.g., being an upstream user increases the likelihood to contribute to labor maintenance efforts. We further discuss how decisions with respect to the land sector could be designed in the future to facilitate cooperation in other resource sectors. Further, we conclude from a conceptual perspective that the SES framework integrating a nexus perspective can be adapted: either (1) by adding a second-tier “governance nexus” variable inside the governance variable of an irrigation system; or (2) by adding a land resource unit and system outside the irrigation system.

Some authors report such estimates as one of the outcome variables of experiment station studies, while others calculate water productivities when comparing regional crop production information. Many authors suggest or imply that higher values of water productivity are needed to ensure that future food production goals are achieved. Yet maximizing water productivity might not be consistent with farm-level goals or with societal objectives regarding water allocation and management. Farmers in both rainfed and irrigated settings must address a complex set of issues pertaining to risk, uncertainty, prices, and opportunity costs, when selecting activities and determining optimal strategies. It is not clear that farmers in either setting will or should choose to maximize water productivity. Upon examining water productivity, both conceptually and empirically, using published versions of crop production functions, I conclude that estimates of water productivity contain too little information to enhance understanding of farm-level water management.

However, yield stability is a relevant factor in agronomic practice and, therefore, is the focus of this comprehensive survey. The aim was to first describe the importance of yield stability as well as currently used practical management strategies that ensure yield stability in wheat production and secondly, to obtain potential research areas supporting yield stability in the complex system of agronomy. The target groups were German farmers with experience in wheat production and advisors with expertise in the field of wheat cultivation or research. A sample size of 615 completed questionnaires formed the data basis of this study. The study itself provides evidence that the yield stability of winter wheat is even more important than the amount of yield for a large proportion of farmers (48%) and advisors (47%). Furthermore, in the view of the majority of the surveyed farmers and advisors, yield stability is gaining importance in climate change. Data analysis showed that site adapted cultivar choice, favorable crop rotations and integrated plant protection are ranked as three of the most important agronomic management practices to achieve high yield stability of wheat. Soil tillage and fertilization occupied a middle position, whereas sowing date and sowing density were estimated with lower importance. However, yield stability is affected by many environmental, genetic and agronomic factors, which subsequently makes it a complex matter. Hence, yield stability in farming practice must be analyzed and improved in a systems approach.

In some cases, excessive fertilizers or side-dressings are applied when circumstances are not favorable for uptake. Aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems are sensitive to enrichment with nutrients, but growers also benefit when losses are avoided. In this study, the potential of proximal optical sensors to optimize nitrogen fertilization was investigated in four woody species: Acer pseudoplatanus L., Ligustrum ovalifolium Hassk., Prunus laurocerasus ‘Rotundifolia’ L. and Tilia cordata Mill. For three consecutive growing seasons, plants were grown under three different fertilization levels to generate different nitrogen contents. Plant growth and nitrogen uptake were monitored regularly and combined with sensor measurements including Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD), Dualex and GreenSeeker. Here, we show that optical sensors at the leaf level have good potential for assisting growers in the sustainable management of their nursery fields, especially if leaf mass per area is included. Nevertheless, care should be taken when plants with different leaf characteristics (e.g., wax-layer, color, and leaf thickness) are measured. When all measuring years were considered, high correlations (R2 ≥ 0.80) were found between area-based foliar nitrogen content and its non-destructive proxy (i.e., chlorophyll)measured by Dualex or SPAD. Based on our results, we recommend a relative rather than absolute approach at the nursery level, as the number of species and cultivars produced is very diverse. Hence, knowledge of absolute threshold values is scarce. In this relative approach, a saturation index was calculated based on the sensor measurements of plants grown in a reference plot with an ample nitrogen supply.

A new generation of crops that yield more with fewer inputs and are adapted to more variable environments is needed.

Hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) nanoparticles (nHA) have an interesting potential to be used as nanofertilizers. In this study, the effects of different nHA solutions stabilized with carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) were evaluated on germination, seedling growth, and metabolism of Solanum lycopersicum L., used as model species. Our observations showed that the percentage germination of S. lycopersicum is not influenced by increasing concentrations of nHa, while root elongation is strongly stimulated. Tomato plants grown in hydroponics in the presence of nHA have not suffered phytotoxic effects.

However, some necrotrophic pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea, actively induce the SA pathway, resulting in cell death that allows the pathogen to proliferate in the plant. Starting from an isogenic canola (Brassica napus) line, epilines were selected with a reduced sensitivity to SA. The genes belonging to the SA pathway had an altered transcription profile in the SA-tolerant lines, when treated with SA. Besides the already known genes of the SA pathway, new SA target genes were identified, creating possibilities to better understand the plant defense mechanism against pathogens. The SA-tolerant line with the lowest SA-induced gene expression is tolerant to Botrytis cinerea.

In this study, we compared the foraging behavior of corn leaf aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis) on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings grown under contrasted CO2 concentrations. During the dual choice bioassays, the winged and wingless aphids were more attracted by the VOCs of barley seedlings cultivated under ambient CO2 concentrations (aCO2; 450 ppm) than barley seedlings cultivated under elevated CO2 concentrations (eCO2; 800 ppm), nymphs were not attracted by the VOCs of eCO2 barley seedlings. Then, volatile compositions from 14-d-old aCO2 and eCO2 barley seedlings were investigated by GC-MS. While 16 VOCs were identified from aCO2 barley seedlings, only 9 VOCs were found from eCO2 barley seedlings. At last, we discussed the potential role of these chemicals observed during choice bioassays.

Although roughly 60% of the continent’s population is engaged in agriculture, the produce from this sector cannot feed its citizens. Hence, in 2013 alone, Africa imported 56.5 million tons of wheat, maize, and soybean at the cost of 18.8 billion USD. Although crops cultivated in Africa play a vital role in their contribution to Food Security, they produce inferior yields compared to those in other parts of the world. For instance, the average cereal yield in Africa is only 1.6 t·ha−1 compared to the global 3.9 t·ha−1. Low productivity in Africa is also related to poor soil fertility and scarce moisture, as well as a variety of insect pests, diseases, and weeds. While moisture scarcity is responsible for up to 60% of yield losses in some African staple cereals, insect pests inflict annually substantial crop losses. In order to devise a strategy towards boosting crop productivity on the continent where food insecurity is most prevalent, these production constraints should be investigated and properly addressed. This review focuses on conventional (also known as genetic) intensification in which crop productivity is raised through breeding for cultivars with high yield-potential and those that thrive well under diverse and extreme environmental conditions. Improved crop varieties alone do not boost crop productivity unless supplemented with optimum soil, water, and plant management practices as well as the promotion of policies pertaining to inputs, credit, extension, and marketing. Studies in Kenya and Uganda have shown that the yield of cassava can be increased by 140% in farmers’ fields using improved varieties and management practices. In addition to traditional organic and inorganic fertilizers, biochar and African Dark Earths have been found to improve soil properties and to enhance productivity, although their availability and affordability to African farmers remains to be explored. The concept of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) has been successfully implemented in some African countries in the Great Lake Region. Other innovative technologies favorably accepted by farmers are the “Push-pull System” (an elegant method of controlling a devastating insect pest and a parasitic weed) and NERICA (New Rice for Africa, in which rice varieties with desirable nutritional and agronomic properties were developed by crossing Asian and African rice). This review calls for African governments and institutions not only to provide conducive environments but also to abide by the Maputo 2003 Declaration where they agreed to invest 10% of their national budget to agricultural research and development as the outcome has a positive impact on productivity and ultimately improves the livelihood of farmers.

The pasture height provided by UAS products showed good agreement (R2 = 0.62) with a reference terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) dataset.

The mixed approach combining the UAS sward height and spectral data performed the best (adj. R2 = 0.49). This approach reached a quality comparable to that of more conventional non-destructive on-field pasture biomass monitoring tools. As all of the UAS variables used in the model fitting process were extracted from spatial information (raster data), a high spatial resolution map of pasture biomass was derived based on the best fitted model. A sward height differences map was also derived from UAS-based sward height maps before and after grazing. Our results demonstrate the potential of UAS imagery as a tool for precision grazing study applications. The UAS approach to height and biomass monitoring was revealed to be a potential alternative to the widely used but time-consuming field approaches. While reaching a similar level of accuracy to the conventional field sampling approach, the UAS approach provides wall-to-wall pasture characterization through very high spatial resolution maps, opening up a new area of research for precision grazing.

The effect of these amendments on plant growth may depend on physicochemical soil parameters, in particular pH. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of soil pH on biomass production, P use efficiency, and soil P forms after P amendment application (100 mg kg−1 P) using poultry manure compost (PM), rock phosphate (RP), and their combination (PMRP). We performed a growth chamber experiment with ryegrass plants (Lolium perenne) grown on two soil types with contrasting pH under controlled conditions for 7 weeks. Chemical P fractions, biomass production, and P concentrations were measured to calculate plant uptake and P use efficiency. We found a strong synergistic effect on the available soil P, while antagonistic effects were observed for ryegrass production and P uptake. We conclude that although the combination of PM and RP has positive effects in terms of soil P availability, the combined effects of the mixture must be taken into account and further evaluated for different soil types and grassland plants to maximize synergistic effects and to minimize antagonistic ones.

Rosemary plants were submitted to different water treatments: tap water (TW), salt water (SW) and without irrigation (NIR). GC/MS analysis showed that ten and eleven volatile compounds were identified in essential oil of rosemary plants irrigated with tap water (TW) and salt water (SW), respectively. However, thirteen volatile compounds were identified in essential oil of non-irrigated plants (NIR). Moreover, among these compounds, α-Pinene, Eucalyptol (1,8 Cineol), Camphene, Borneol, D-verbenone, Bornyl acetate were the major components of oil. Also, GC/MS results highlighted that non-irrigated rosemary plants showed the highest essential oil yield (Y). Obtained oil yields followed the order YNIR > YTW > YSW. In conclusion, qualitative and quantitative differences in rosemary essential oil components were highlighted in relation to water stress.

The use of remote sensing can substantially support traditional field inventories to evaluate and characterize this resource. Existing studies have already realized the automated detection of trees outside the forest (TOF) and classified the subsequently mapped TOF into three geometrical classes: single objects, linear objects, and ample objects. This study goes further by presenting a fully automated classification method that can support the operational management of TOF as it separates TOF into seven classes matching the definitions used in field inventories: Isolated tree, Aligned trees, Agglomerated trees, Hedge, Grove, Shrub, and Other. Using publicly available software tools, an orthophoto, and a LIDAR canopy height model (CHM), a TOF map was produced and a two-step method was developed for the classification of TOF: (1) the geometrical classification of each TOF polygon; and (2) the spatial neighboring analysis of elements and their classification into seven classes. The overall classification accuracy was 78%. Our results highlight that an automated TOF classification is possible with classes matching the definitions used in field inventories. This suggests that remote sensing has a huge potential to support the operational management of TOF as well as other research areas regarding TOF.

The aim of this work is the characterization of a new variety of red escarole obtained after a long-term breeding program involving the interspecies crossing between red radicchio and green escarole. Our multidisciplinary approach of investigation allowed us to study the effects of the crossing on several aspects, including the accumulation of phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, the expression pattern of some of the key genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway, and the sensory profiling of the new variety obtained. Given the results, it is possible to conclude that the new variety of red escarole presents traits deriving from both radicchio and escarole. The sensory profile and the preliminary data on yield, suggests that red escarole has interesting characteristics that could be successfully introduced into the market of leafy crops.

This study provides an approach for modeling the joint impact of inorganic N and P fertilization on crop production, considering the P supplied by the soil, which was approximated using the soil test P (STP). We developed yield response models for Finnish spring barley crops (Hordeum vulgare L.) for clay and coarse-textured soils by using existing extensive experimental datasets and nonlinear estimation techniques. Model selection was based on iterative elimination from a wide diversity of plausible model formulations. The Cobb−Douglas type model specification, consisting of multiplicative elements, performed well against independent validation data, suggesting that the key relationships that determine crop responses are captured by the models. The estimated models were extended to dynamic economic optimization of fertilization inputs. According to the results, a fair STP level should be maintained on both coarse-textured soils (9.9 mg L−1 a−1) and clay soils (3.9 mg L−1 a−1). For coarse soils, a higher steady-state P fertilization rate is required (21.7 kg ha−1 a−1) compared with clay soils (6.75 kg ha−1 a−1). The steady-state N fertilization rate was slightly higher for clay soils (102.4 kg ha−1 a−1) than for coarse soils (95.8 kg ha−1 a−1). This study shows that the iterative elimination of plausible functional forms is a suitable method for reducing the effects of structural uncertainty on model output and optimal fertilization decisions.

In the laboratory experiment, the Unikum genotype showed the highest seed germination (95.1%), whereas the lowest was found for Kinelskoje (80.4%). Regardless of the osmoticum type, germination was significantly reduced by osmotic pressure increases. Unikum showed a higher fresh biomass yield (FBY) (620.4 ± 126.3 g m−2) than Kinelskoje (340.0 ± 73.5 g m−2). AMF inoculation did not influence FBY under salt conditions, while in the absence of salt conditions it significantly increased the Unikum FBY (+50.7%) as compared to the uninoculated treatment (552.5 ± 269 g m−2). The 25% ETm significantly reduced FBY in both genotypes (−86.2% and −84.1% for Unikum and Kinelskoje, respectively) sd compared to the 100% ETm treatments (1090.3 ± 49.7 g m−2 in Unikum and 587 ± 72.2 g m−2 in Kinelskoje). The obtained results give novel information about proso millet forage production in low-input agriculture in marginal semi-arid Mediterranean land.

On a large scale, LAI can be estimated with the help of imaging spectroscopy. However, recent studies have revealed that the leaf angle greatly affects the spectral reflectance of the canopy and hence imaging spectroscopy data. To investigate the effects of the leaf angle on LAI-sensitive narrowband vegetation indices, we used both empirical measurements from field crops and model-simulated data generated by the PROSAIL canopy reflectance model. We found the relationship between vegetation indices and LAI to be notably affected, especially when the leaf mean tilt angle (MTA) exceeded 70 degrees. Of the indices used in the study, the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) was most strongly affected by leaf angles, while the blue normalized difference vegetation index (BNDVI), the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), the modified simple ratio using the wavelength of 705 nm (MSR705), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were only affected for sparse canopies (LAI < 3) and MTA exceeding 60°. Generally, the effect of MTA on the vegetation indices increased as a function of decreasing LAI. The leaf chlorophyll content did not affect the relationship between BNDVI, MSAVI, NDVI, and LAI, while the green atmospherically resistant index (GARI), GNDVI, and MSR705 were the most strongly affected indices. While the relationship between SR and LAI was somewhat affected by both MTA and the leaf chlorophyll content, the simple ratio (SR) displayed only slight saturation with LAI, regardless of MTA and the chlorophyll content. The best index found in the study for LAI estimation was BNDVI, although it performed robustly only for LAI > 3 and showed considerable nonlinearity. Thus, none of the studied indices were well suited for across-species LAI estimation: information on the leaf angle would be required for remote LAI measurement, especially at low LAI values. Nevertheless, narrowband indices can be used to monitor the LAI of crops with a constant leaf angle distribution. View Full-Text',\n"," 'Crop growth in different periods influences the final yield. This study started from the agronomic mechanism of yield formation and aimed to extract useful spectral characteristics in different phenological phases, which could directly describe the final yield and dynamic contributions of different phases to the yield formation. Hyperspectral information of the winter wheat canopy was acquired during three important phases (jointing stage, heading stage, and grain-filling stage). An enhanced 2D correlation spectral analysis method modified by mutual information was proposed to identify the sensitive wavebands. The selected wavebands performed well with good mechanism interpretation and close correlation with important crop growth parameters and main physiological activities related to yield formation. The quantitative contribution proportions of plant growth in three phases to the final yield were estimated by determining the coefficients of partial least square models based on full spectral information. They were then used as single-phase weight factors to merge the selected wavebands. The support vector machine model based on the weighted spectral dataset performed well in yield prediction with satisfactory accuracy and robustness. This result would provide rapid and accurate guidance for agricultural production and would be valuable for the processing of hyperspectral remote sensing data.

Eighteen (18) commercial formulations were identified, with more than 50% of pesticides destined for cotton production. Eleven active substances have been identified and the most frequently used are λ-cyhalothrin (35%), acetamiprid (22%) and profenofos (13%). The most commonly used chemical families are pyrethroids (28%) and organophosphates (18%). The study revealed a low level of training for producers, a high use of pesticides according to the Frequency Treatment Indicator, and a very low level of protection used by producers. The Health Risk Index shows that active substances such as methomyl, λ-cyhalothrin and profenofos present very high risk to operators’ health. Based on the UK-POEM model, the predictive exposure levels obtained varied from 0.0105 mg/kg body weight/day to 1.7855 mg/kg body weight/day, which is several times higher than the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level. However, the study also shows that exposure can be greatly reduced if the required Personal Protective Equipment is worn. Producers’ awareness and training on integrated pest management are necessary to reduce the risks linked to the pesticides use in Burkina Faso.

The composition of ground vegetation on pastures determines the value of both the forage for grazing animals as well as the biodiversity values for species associated with the pastoral ecosystems. We studied three pastures, each representing one of the management types in southern Finland (latitudes 60–61): semi-natural, permanent and cultivated grassland. All have been grazed exclusively by horses for several decades. We aimed to evaluate feeding values and horses’ welfare, on the one hand, and impacts of horses on biodiversity in boreal conditions, on the other. Though there were differences among the pastures, the nutritional value of the vegetation in all three pastures met the energy and protein needs of most horse categories through the whole grazing season. Some mineral concentrations were low compared to the requirements, and supplementation of Cu, Zn and Na is needed to balance the mineral intake. Only minor injuries or health problems were observed. All metrics of biological values, as well as number of species eaten by horses, were particularly high in a semi-natural pasture compared to other pasture types. The highest ratio of species cover preferred by horses to the total cover was found in the permanent pasture, while at the regularly re-seeded pasture, there was a particularly high cover of species, indicating low biodiversity values on grassland. There was, therefore, a trade-off between the quantity of forage and biological values in pastures, but not in quality. The results provide clear indication both for the suitability of the studied pasture types to horses and for grazing of horses for biodiversity management. In each pasture type, specific management is needed to simultaneously achieve objectives of adequate pasturing and biodiversity. The short duration (only one grazing season) must be considered when applying the results.

CLCuD is caused by monopartite plant viruses belonging to the family Geminiviridae (genus Begomovirus), in association with an essential, disease-specific satellite, Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) belonging to a newly-established family Tolecusatellitidae (genus Betasatellite). CLCuMuB has a small genome (ca. 1350 nt) with a satellite conserved region, an adenine-rich region and a single gene that encodes for a multifunctional βC1 protein. CLCuMuB βC1 protein has a major role in pathogenicity and symptom determination, and alters several host cellular functions like autophagy, ubiquitination, and suppression of gene silencing, to assist CLCuD infectivity. Efficient trans-replication ability of CLCuMuB with several monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses, is also associated with the rapid evolution and spread of CLCuMuB. In this article we comprehensively reviewed the role of CLCuMuB in CLCuD, focusing on the βC1 functions and its interactions with host proteins.

The bouquets were collected from 50 florists located in the seven largest cities of Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ghent, Leuven, Liege, and Namur) and from five supermarkets located in the different regions. To have a better understanding of the route of exposure and professional practices a questionnaire was also addressed to a group of 25 florists who volunteered to take part in the survey. All florists were interviewed individually when collecting the questionnaire. The residual pesticide deposit values on cut flowers were determined in an accredited laboratory using a multi-residue (QuEChERS Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged Safe) method and a combination of gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chormatograhphy (LC) analysis. A total of 107 active substances were detected from all samples; i.e., an average of about 10 active substances per bouquet. The most severely contaminated bouquet accumulated a total concentration of residues up to 97 mg/kg. Results show that roses are the most contaminated cut flowers; with an average of 14 substances detected per sample and a total concentration per rose sample of 26 mg/kg. Some active substances present an acute toxicity (acephate, methiocarb, monocrotophos, methomyl, deltamethrin, etc.) and exposure can generate a direct effect on the nervous system of florists. Nevertheless, fungicides (dodemorph, propamocarb, and procymidone) were the most frequently detected in samples and had the highest maximum concentrations out of all the active substances analysed. Dodemorph was the most frequently detected substance with the highest maximum concentration (41.9 mg/kg) measured in the rose samples. It appears from the survey that, despite being exposed to high deposits of residues, florists usually do not protect themselves from contact with residues even if they spend several hours handling cut flowers and preparing bouquets (from 2 to 6 h/day, depending on the time of year and/or selling periods) daily. Bad habits (eating, drinking, or smoking at work) and absence of personal protective equipment of most florists also increase the risk of contact with pesticide residues.

Some of its roles include the participation in the antioxidant defense the cattle farms. The nutritional requirements of Se in cattle are estimated at 100 μg/kg DM (dry matter) for beef cattle and at 300 μg/kg DM for dairy cows. The rations high in fermentable carbohydrates, nitrates, sulfates, calcium or hydrogen cyanide negatively influence the organism’s use of the selenium contained in the diet. The Se supplementation may reduce the incidence of metritis and ovarian cysts during the postpartum period. The increase in fertility when adding Se is attributed to the reduction of the embryonic death during the first month of gestation. A use of organic Se in feed would provide a better transfer of Se in calves relative to mineral Se supplementation. The addition of Se yeasts in the foodstuffs of cows significantly increases the Se content and the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in milk compared to the addition of sodium selenite. The enzyme 5-iodothyronine deiodinase is a seleno-dependent selenoprotein. It is one of the last proteins to be affected in the event of Se deficiency. This delay in response could explain the fact that several studies did not show the effect of Se supplementation on growth and weight gain of calves. Enrichment of Se in the diet did not significantly affect the slaughter weight and carcass yield of bulls. The impact and results of Se supplementation in cattle depend on physiological stage, Se status of animals, type and content of Se and types of Se administration. Further studies in Se supplementation should investigate the speciation of Se in food and yeasts, as well as understanding their metabolism and absorption. This constitute a path to exploit in order to explain certain different effects of Se.

An effective method to enhance phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) and its availability to plants is the application of alginate bioaugmented coated di-ammonium phosphate (DAP). In this study, the pre-isolated P solubilizing Paraburkholderia phytofirmans (PsJN) coated with different concentrations of polymer (alginate) on DAP with and without carbon source was tested in incubation, pot, and field experiments to investigate microbial survival, Olsen P release, and its availability to plants. Results indicated that the maximum recovery of PsJN loaded on alginate at 30 days incubation with and without carbon source was 199 × 1010 and 82 × 106 CFU mL−1 respectively. Application of alginate bioaugmented DAP released 962 mg kg−1 Olsen P after 60 days of incubation compared to 280 and 370 mg kg−1 Olsen P released by uncoated and simple alginate coated DAP, respectively. Results from pot trial revealed that application of 100% alginate bioaugmented DAP increased 26% plant height, 31% photosynthetic rate, 55% grain yield, and 6 × 105 CFU g−1 root bacterial population, compared to uncoated DAP. Field trial results indicated that 22% grain yield, 14% straw yield, and 44% agronomy P efficiency were increased by applying 100% alginate bioaugmented DAP compared to uncoated DAP. This new approach resulted in controlled release of P from coated DAP that not only reduced phosphorus fixation but also enhanced the bioavailability of P to plants.

Ethylene induces many functions in latex cells including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation of ROS is responsible for the coagulation of rubber particles in latex cells, resulting in the partial or complete stoppage of latex flow. This study set out to assess biochemical and histological changes as well as changes in gene expression in latex and phloem tissues from trees grown under various harvesting systems. The Tapping Panel Dryness (TPD) susceptibility of Hevea clones was found to be related to some biochemical parameters, such as low sucrose and high inorganic phosphorus contents. A high tapping frequency and ethephon stimulation induced early TPD occurrence in a high latex metabolism clone and late occurrence in a low latex metabolism clone. TPD-affected trees had smaller number of laticifer vessels compared to healthy trees, suggesting a modification of cambial activity. The differential transcript abundance was observed for twenty-seven candidate genes related to TPD occurrence in latex and phloem tissues for ROS-scavenging, ethylene biosynthesis and signalling genes. The predicted function for some Ethylene Response Factor genes suggested that these candidate genes should play an important role in regulating susceptibility to TPD.

Currently, growers in Illinois and other neighboring states in the U.S. Midwest use the maximum return to N (MRTN) decision support system to predict corn N requirements. However, the current tool does not factor in implications of integrating cover crops into the rotation, which has recently gained attention among growers due to several ecosystem services associated with cover cropping. A two-year field trail was conducted at the Agronomy Research Center in Carbondale, IL in 2018 and 2019 to evaluate whether split N application affects nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of corn with and without a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cover crop. A randomized complete block design with split plot arrangements and four replicates was used. Main plots were cover crop treatments (no cover crop (control) compared to a wheat cover crop) and subplots were N timing applications to the corn: (1) 168 kg N ha−1 at planting; (2) 56 kg N ha−1 at planting + 112 kg N ha−1 at sidedress; (3) 112 kg N ha−1 at planting + 56 kg N ha−1 at sidedress; and (4) 168 kg N ha−1 at sidedress along with a zero-N control as check plot. Corn yield was higher in 2018 than 2019 reflecting more timely precipitation in that year. In 2018, grain yield declined by 12.6% following the wheat cover crop compared to no cover crop control, indicating a yield penalty when corn was preceded with a wheat cover crop. In 2018, a year with timely and sufficient rainfall, there were no yield differences among N treatments and N balances were near zero. In 2019, delaying the N application improved NUE and corn grain yield due to excessive rainfall early in the season reflecting on N losses which was confirmed by lower N balances in sidedressed treatments. Overall, our findings suggest including N credit for cereals in MRTN prediction model could help with improved N management in the Midwestern United States.

Bioenergy crops provide one means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy production and two novel crops that could be used for this purpose are Sida hermaphrodita (L.) Rusby and Silphium perfoliatum L. This research examined the existing scientific literature available on both crops through a systematic review. The data were collated according to the agronomy, uses, and environmental benefits of each crop. Possible challenges were associated with high initial planting costs, low yields in low rainfall areas, and for Sida hermaphrodita, vulnerability to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. However, under appropriate environmental conditions, both crops were found to provide large yields over sustained periods of time with relatively low levels of management and could be used to produce large energy surpluses, either through direct combustion or biogas production. Other potential uses included fodder, fibre, and pharmaceutical uses. Environmental benefits included the potential for phytoremediation, and improvements to soil health, biodiversity, and pollination. The review also demonstrated that environmental benefits, such as pollination, soil health, and water quality benefits could be obtained from the use of Sida hermaphrodita and Silphium perfoliatum relative to existing bioenergy crops such as maize, whilst at the same time reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy production. Future research should examine the long-term implications of using Sida hermaphrodita and Silphium perfoliatum as well as improve knowledge on how to integrate them successfully within existing farming systems and supply chains.

As wheat is the most important crop in Poland, with a total of about 22% of the total sown area, the study of its performance in environments with different productivity levels for consequent cultivar recommendation is of major importance. In this paper, we assess the relative performance of winter wheat cultivars in environments with different productivity and propose a method for cultivar recommendation, by considering the information of environmental conditions and drought stress. This is performed in the following steps: (1) calculation of expected wheat productivity, depending on environmental factors, (2) calculation of relative productivity of cultivars in the environments, and (3) recommendation of cultivars of a specific type and range of adaptation. Soil and weather conditions were confirmed as the most important factors affecting winter wheat yield. The weather factors should be considered rather in shorter (e.g., 10 day) than longer (e.g., 60 day) time periods and in relation to growth stages. The ANCOVA model with genotype and management intensity as fixed factors, and soil and weather parameters as covariates was proposed to assess the expected wheat productivity in particular environments and the expected performance of each genotype (cultivar). The recommendation of cultivars for locations of specified productivity was proposed based on the difference between the expected cultivar yield and the mean wheat productivity, and compared with the Polish official cultivar recommendation list.

In general, the higher-yielding cultivars under inversion tillage conditions gave lower yields under non-inversion tillage, whereas low-yielding older cultivars showed relatively smaller reductions in yield under non-inversion tillage. A few cultivars showed preferential yield performance for either inversion or non-inversion tillage and this was irrespective of their overall yield performance. There was no pedigree or breeding programme link between these cultivars and no above-ground gross morphological trait observed was associated with tillage adaptation. Root hairs may contribute to inversion tillage adaptation as a root hair absence mutant was associated with non-inversion adaptation and it is likely that other root-associated traits are responsible also for tillage adaptation. There was no overall cultivar or tillage interaction with rhynchosporium symptoms but a differential tillage interaction may occur in individual years. We have identified clearly contrasting cultivars and tested their across-season robustness with respect to tillage treatment for further detailed mechanistic studies and identification of tillage adaptation traits.

The Northern Grains Region (NGR) of Australia, which accounts for nearly 95% of chickpea production in Australia, is frequently subjected to such events. The objective of this study was to map frost risk in chickpea in the NGR and develop strategies to minimise the impacts of such risk. The Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) modelling framework was used to determine spatial and temporal trends in post-flowering frost risk. The NGR could be divided into six broad sub-regions, each delineating locations with similar frost risk. The risk was nearly two to three times greater in the Southern Downs and Darling Downs sub-regions as compared to the Central Queensland Highlands, Dawson Callide, New South Wales, and Northern New South Wales–Western Downs sub-regions. There was an increasing trend in the frequency of frost events in the Southern Downs and New South Wales sub-regions, and a decreasing trend in the Central Queensland Highlands and Dawson Callide sub-regions, consistent with the changing climate of the NGR. In each sub-region, frost risk declined with delayed sowings, but such sowings resulted in simulation of reduced water limited yield potential (unfrosted) as well. The model output was also used to compute 10, 30, 50, and 70% probabilities of the last day of experiencing −3 to 2 °C minimum temperatures and identify the earliest possible sowings that would avoid such temperatures after flowering. Choosing the earliest sowing times with a 30% frost risk could help increase overall yields in environments with high frost risk. Simulations involving genotype x environment x management interactions suggested additional opportunities to minimise frost losses through the adoption of particular cultivars of differing phenology and the use of different agronomy in various environments of the NGR. The study indicates that there is considerable variation in frost risk across the NGR and that manipulating flowering times either through time of sowing or cultivar choice could assist in minimising yield losses in chickpea due to frost.

Over recent decades there has been growing appreciation that the prime involvement of clay minerals in the geochemical cycling of elements and pedosphere genesis should take into account the biogeochemical activity of microorganisms. Microbial intimate interaction with clay minerals, that has taken place on Earth’s surface in a geological time-scale, represents a complex co-evolving system which is challenging to comprehend because of fragmented information and requires coordinated efforts from both clay scientists and microbiologists. This review covers some important aspects of the interactions of clay minerals with microorganisms at the different levels of complexity, starting from organic molecules, individual and aggregated microbial cells, fungal and bacterial symbioses with photosynthetic organisms, pedosphere, up to environmental and biotechnological implications. The review attempts to systematize our current general understanding of the processes of biogeochemical transformation of clay minerals by microorganisms. This paper also highlights some microbiological and biotechnological perspectives of the practical application of clay minerals–microbes interactions not only in microbial bioremediation and biodegradation of pollutants but also in areas related to agronomy and human and animal health.

However, demonstrating this process in a scientific manner entails substantial endeavors from different disciplines. In the present review, we will describe the features of a native vegetation system traditionally used by small ruminants and use its particularities to build an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate the nutraceutical properties of plants. Initially, we will establish the context of the low deciduous forest (LDF), considering some botanical and nutritional aspects, as well as the presence of plant secondary compounds (PSC) and gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). Furthermore, we will focus on coevolutionary aspects that undoubtedly shaped the plants–nutrients–PSC–GIN–herbivore relationship. In addition, the concept of nutraceutical will be discussed to provide clarity and aspects to be considered for their evaluation. Then, ethological, agronomical, nutritional, PSC, parasitological and animal species issues are deepened placing emphasis on methodological approaches. Special focus is given to condensed tannins, as they are the fourth largest group of PSCs and the most studied in livestock sciences. Validation of the nutraceutical properties of plants from native vegetation systems should be seen as a process derived from many scientific disciplines that feed into each other in a cyclic manner.

The aim of this study is to quantify and analyze the trends of BSP in winter wheat seasons using the decision support system for agrotechnologie transfer (DSSAT) model under a long-term fertilization experiment in the dark loessal soil region of the Loess Plateau of China. In addition, we evaluated the contribution percentage of BSP to yield and its influencing factors. A long-term fertilization experiment with a winter wheat/spring maize rotation was established in 1979 in a field of the Gaoping Agronomy Farm, Pingliang, Gansu, China, including six treatments: (1) no fertilizer as a control (CK), (2) chemical nitrogen fertilizer input annually (N), (3) chemical nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer input annually (NP), (4) straw return and chemical nitrogen fertilizer input annually plus phosphorus fertilizer added every second year (SNP), (5) manure input annually (M), and (6) M plus N and P fertilizers added annually (MNP). The application of the DSSAT-CERES-Wheat model showed a satisfactory performance with good Wilmott d-index (0.78~0.95) and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) (7.03%~18.72%) values for the tested genetic parameters of winter wheat. After the 26-years experiment, the yield by BSP of winter wheat under the M and MNP treatment significantly increased, at the rate of 2.7% and 3.82% a year, respectively, whereas that of CK and N treatments significantly decreased, at the rate of 0.23% and 3.03%. Moreover, the average contribution percentage of BSP to yield was 47.0%, 39.4%, 56.3%, 50.0%, and 61.9% in N, NP, SNP, M, and MNP treatments, respectively. In addition, soil organic carbon contents were the main controls of BSP under the different fertilization conditions in the dark loessial soil area. As a result, the combined application of organic fertilizer or straw and chemical fertilizer can be an effective form of fertilization management to greatly enrich basic soil productivity, continually promote the contribution percentage of BSP, and ultimately increase crop yield.

Fertilizer application influences overall soil characteristics, including soil microbial community composition and metabolic processes mediated by microbial enzymatic activity. Changes in the structure of microbial communities and their metabolic activity after long-term fertilization were studied in this research. We hypothesized that the different types of fertilization regimes affect nutrient levels in the soil which subsequently influence the metabolic processes and microbial diversity and community structure. Manure (MF; 330 kg N/ha), sewage sludge at two application doses (SF; 330 kg N/ha and SF3x; 990 kg N/ha) and chemical (NPK; N-P-K nutrients in concentrations of 330-90-300 kg/ha) fertilizers have been applied regularly to an experimental field since 1996. The microbial diversity increased in all soils amended with both organic (MF, SF, SF3x) and chemical (NPK) fertilizers. The shifts in microbial communities were observed, which were mainly caused by less abundant genera that were mostly associated with one or more fertilization treatment(s). Fertilization also influenced soil chemistry and the activity of β-xylosidase, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG), acid phosphatase and FDA-hydrolases. Specifically, all fertilization treatments were associated with a higher activity of β xylosidase and lower NAG activity. Only the NPK treatment was associated with a higher activity of acid phosphatase.

Abiotic stresses such as drought, extreme temperatures, salinity, and nutrient deficiencies are causing increasing losses in terms of yield and product quality. The horticultural sector is therefore searching for innovative and sustainable agronomic tools to enhance crop tolerance towards these unfavorable conditions. In a recent review published in Agronomy, “Biostimulants Application in Horticultural Crops under Abiotic Stress Conditions”, Bulgari and colleagues discussed the main pieces of evidence of the use of biostimulants to manage abiotic stresses in vegetable crops. The intent of this editorial was to focus the attention on aspects related to the stress development in plants (i.e., timing and occurrence of multiple stress factors), in combination with the application of biostimulants. The large number of factors potentially involved in the enhancement of crop tolerance toward stress calls for an intensification of research activities, especially when conducted in field conditions and with well-defined protocols. This must be seen as a mandatory task for a successful implementation of biostimulant products among the available agronomic tools for the management of abiotic stresses in horticultural crops.

So far, these regulatory molecules have been separately studied despite sharing a common biosynthetic precursor and their similar physiological actions and stress regulation signals. The review published in Agronomy by Hernández-Ruiz and Arnao entitled “Relationship of melatonin and salicylic acid in biotic/abiotic stress responses” highlights the coincidences and similarities of both regulatory molecules via a thorough literature search and proposes an action model for their interaction in plant stress responses. Despite the undeniable interest and potential impact of this view, it has been focused only on coincident regulatory aspects of SA and melatonin, and the antioxidant-mediated model of interaction that has been proposed is rather speculative and needs to be mechanistically demonstrated. Nevertheless, the mentioned review leads to future research on the melatonin-SA crosstalk to improve biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, which is of utmost importance to ensure food production in the actual age of pandemics and for the upcoming climate crisis scenario.

It has been hypothesized that many problems related to the burying of straw can be overcome by pyrolyzing it. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of straw and its biochar on the biomass production of perennial ryegrass. A pot-based experiment was conducted with three factors: (i) the crop species used as feedstock, (ii) raw or pyrolyzed organic material, and (iii) the rate of organic amendments. The soil in the pots was amended with straw and biochar produced from Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) or winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). After soil amendment application, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) seeds were sown. During two years of the experiment, the perennial ryegrass above-ground biomass production and root biomass and morphology parameters were determined. Straw and biochar resulted in higher perennial ryegrass above-ground biomass compared with that of the non-fertilized control. However, straw amendment resulted in lower plant yields of above-ground biomass than those of the biochar treatments or the mineral fertilizer control treatment. The feedstock type (Miscanthus or wheat) significantly affected the perennial ryegrass yield. No difference was observed among wheat and Miscanthus biochar, while among straws, Miscanthus resulted in lower perennial ryegrass productivity (the higher rate of straw and biochar as soil amendments resulted in relatively high perennial ryegrass productivity). The organic amendments resulted in relatively high root biomass and length. The root:shoot ratio was lower in the treatments in which biochar was used, whereas feedstock species and amendment rate were not statistically significant for any of the root biomass and morphometric parameters. The results suggest that the use of pyrolyzed straw can be a reliable strategy instead of straw, increasing ryegrass growth and productivity.

Today, many bioenergy cropping systems (BCS) are suboptimal due to either social-ecological threats or technical limitations. In addition, the competition for land between bioenergy-crop cultivation, food-crop cultivation, and biodiversity conservation is expected to increase as a result of both continuous world population growth and expected severe climate change effects. This study investigates how BCS can become more social-ecologically sustainable in future. It brings together expert opinions from the fields of agronomy, economics, meteorology, and geography. Potential solutions to the following five main requirements for a more holistically sustainable supply of biomass are summarized: (i) bioenergy-crop cultivation should provide a beneficial social-ecological contribution, such as an increase in both biodiversity and landscape aesthetics, (ii) bioenergy crops should be cultivated on marginal agricultural land so as not to compete with food-crop production, (iii) BCS need to be resilient in the face of projected severe climate change effects, (iv) BCS should foster rural development and support the vast number of small-scale family farmers, managing about 80% of agricultural land and natural resources globally, and (v) bioenergy-crop cultivation must be planned and implemented systematically, using holistic approaches. Further research activities and policy incentives should not only consider the economic potential of bioenergy-crop cultivation, but also aspects of biodiversity, soil fertility, and climate change adaptation specific to site conditions and the given social context. This will help to adapt existing agricultural systems in a changing world and foster the development of a more social-ecologically sustainable bioeconomy.

Measurement of soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution at regional and global scale is needed for the prediction of flood, drought, planning and management of agricultural productivity to ensure food security. Recent advancement in microwave remote sensing, especially after the launch of Sentinel operational satellites has enabled the scientific community to estimate soil moisture at higher spatial and temporal resolution with greater accuracy. This study evaluates the potential of Sentinel-1A satellite images to estimate soil moisture in a semi-arid region. Exactly at the time when satellite passes over the study area, we have collected soil samples at 37 different locations and measured the soil moisture from 5 cm below the ground surface using ML3 theta probe. We processed the soil samples in laboratory to obtain volumetric soil moisture using the oven dry method. We found soil moisture measured from calibrated theta probe and oven dry method are in good agreement with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 0.025 m /m and coefficient of determination (R ) 0.85. We then processed Sentinel-1A images and applied modified Dubois model to calculate relative permittivity of the soil from the backscatter values ( ). The volumetric soil moisture at each pixel is then calculated by applying the universal Topp’s model. Finally, we masked the pixels whose Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value is greater than 0.4 to generate soil moisture map as per the Dubois NDVI criterion. Our modelled soil moisture accord with the measured values with RMSE = 0.035 and R = 0.75. We found a small bias in the modelled soil moisture ( ). However, this has reduced significantly ( ) after applying a bias correction based on Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching. Our approach provides a first-order estimate of soil moisture from Sentinel-1A images in sparsely vegetated agricultural land.

Understanding the genetic basis for salinity tolerance is important to develop salinity tolerant chickpeas. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed using parental lines ICCV 10 (salt-tolerant) and DCP 92-3 (salt-sensitive) was screened under field conditions to collect information on agronomy, yield components, and stress tolerance indices. Genotyping data generated using Axiom®CicerSNP array was used to construct a linkage map comprising 1856 SNP markers spanning a distance of 1106.3 cM across eight chickpea chromosomes. Extensive analysis of the phenotyping and genotyping data identified 28 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) explaining up to 28.40% of the phenotypic variance in the population. We identified QTL clusters on CaLG03 and CaLG06, each harboring major QTLs for yield and yield component traits under salinity stress. The main-effect QTLs identified in these two clusters were associated with key genes such as calcium-dependent protein kinases, histidine kinases, cation proton antiporter, and WRKY and MYB transcription factors, which are known to impart salinity stress tolerance in crop plants. Molecular markers/genes associated with these major QTLs, after validation, will be useful to undertake marker-assisted breeding for developing better varieties with salinity tolerance.

The three most important countries that publish research and were most-cited regarding sugarcane were Brazil, the USA, and India. The analysis of the co-occurrence of terms shows that the main research areas were sugarcane bagasse and terms related to bioenergy, and on a second level of relevance agronomy topics related to increasing crop yields.

Exogenous application of miPEPs increases the expression of their corresponding miRNA and, consequently, induces consistent phenotypical changes. Therefore, miPEPs carry huge potential in agronomy as gene regulators that do not require genome manipulation. However, to this end, it is necessary to know their mode of action, including where they act and how they enter the plants. Here, after analyzing the effect of Arabidopsis thaliana miPEP165a on root and aerial part development, we followed the internalization of fluorescent-labelled miPEP165a into roots and compared its uptake into endocytosis-altered mutants to that observed in wild-type plants treated or not with endocytosis inhibitors. The results show that entry of miPEP165a involves both a passive diffusion at the root apex and endocytosis-associated internalization in the differentiation and mature zones. Moreover, miPEP165a is unable to enter the central cylinder and does not migrate from the roots to the aerial part of the plant, suggesting that miPEPs have no systemic effect.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as an important source of data for monitoring surface water, especially under inclement weather conditions, and is used operationally for flood mapping applications. The canopy penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is generally believed to be a double-bounce scattering mechanism between the water and emergent vegetation. Recent investigations have shown that, under certain conditions, the SAR response signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite over-passes, which can be exploited for interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements to estimate changes in water levels and water topography. InSAR results also suggest that coherence change detection (CCD) might be applied to wetland monitoring applications. This study examines wetland vegetation characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT-2 InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands, and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multi-temporal radar data. The results for a three-year period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the ice-/snow-free time period for the 24-day repeat cycle of RADARSAT-2. However, open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation. We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance; wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence, but also high variability of coherence; and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence, but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands. From this knowledge, we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness (backscatter intensity). This product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide area. With an interpretation key we have also developed, it is possible to distinguish different wetland types and assess year-to-year changes. In the next few years, satellite SAR systems, such as the European Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide rapid revisit capabilities and standard data collection modes, enhancing the operational application of SAR data for assessing wetland conditions and monitoring water levels using InSAR techniques.

Grafting is a technique used to alleviate these problems. Shortage of water has stimulated the introduction of new irrigation methods: deficit irrigation (DI) and partial root-zone drying (PRD). This study was conducted in two spring–summer season experiments to evaluate the effects of three irrigation regimes: full irrigation (FI), PRD and DI on vegetative growth, leaf gas-exchange parameters, yield, water-use efficiency (WUE), nutrients profile and fruit quality of grafted tomatoes. In both years, the commercial rootstocks Emperador and Maxifort were used. In the first year, the scion cultivar Clarabella was grown on one stem and in the second year the cultivar Attiya was grown on two stems. Self-grafted cultivars were grown as a control. In both experiments, higher vegetative traits (leaf area and number, height, shoot biomass) were recorded in tthe plants grafted on commercial rootstocks. The stomatal conductance and transpiration rate were higher under FI. Under DI, transpiration was lowest and photosynthetic WUE was highest. Photosynthetic rate changed between irrigation treatments depending on plant type. In both years, the total yield was highest in grafted plants as result of more and bigger fruits per plant. In the 2nd year, grafted plants under FI had higher yield compared to PRD, but not to DI, while self-grafted plants did not differ between irrigation treatments. WUE was highest in DI and PRD treatments and in grafted plants. Leaf N, P, K and Ca was highest in tthe plants grafted on Emperador and Maxifort, while more Mg was measured in self-grafted plants. More Ca and Mg were recorded in tthe plants under DI and PRD. Fruit mineral concentrations were higher in tthe plants grafted on commercial rootstocks. Total soluble solids differed between irrigation regarding plant types, while fruit total acidity was higher in Emperador and Maxifort. In conclusion, our study showed that grafted plants could be grown under DI with minor yield reduction with 30–40% less water used for irrigation. Moderate DI could be used before PRD for cultivation of grafted tomato and double stemmed plants did not show negative effect on tomato yield so it can be used as standard under reduced irrigation.

In this study, three tomato hybrid (F1) cultivars were grown for year-round production in a commercial semi-closed glasshouse in Southern Italy: two of the cherry fruit-type (‘Juanita’ and ‘Sorentyno’) and one mini plum fruit-type (‘Solarino’). From 120 to 243 days after transplant, light-emitting diode (LED) toplights were used as SL, with a photoperiod of 18 h. The main climatic parameters inside and outside the glasshouse were recorded, and tomato plants’ development and yield were examined. Plants grown with LEDs had longer stems as compared to control treatment (9.53 vs. 8.79 m), a higher stem thickness and yielded more trusses. On average, the yield was 21.7% higher with LEDs. ‘Sorentyno’ was the cultivar with the highest cumulated productivity when it was grown under SL. However, the cultivar with best light use efficiency under LEDs was ‘Solarino’. Therefore, supplemental LED from mid-December until March enhanced tomato growth and yield, opening a favorable scenario for large-scale application of this technology also in the Mediterranean area.

Three independent transgenic lines ectopically overexpressing either barley FC1 or FC2 were selected and evaluated under well-watered, drought, and oxidative stress conditions. Both HvFC1 and HvFC2 overexpressing transgenics showed delayed wilting and maintained higher photosynthetic performance relative to controls, after exposure to soil dehydration. In each case, HvFC overexpression significantly upregulated the nuclear genes associated with detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon drought stress. Overexpression of HvFCs, also suppressed photo-oxidative damage induced by the deregulated tetrapyrrole biosynthesis mutant tigrinad12. Previous studies suggest that only FC1 is implicated in stress defense responses, however, our study demonstrated that both FC1 and FC2 affect drought stress tolerance. As FC-derived free heme was proposed as a chloroplast-to-nuclear signal, heme could act as an important signal, stimulating drought responsive nuclear gene expression.

Fruit quality parameters were influenced by rootstocks, and this effect was mostly harvest time -dependent. External color was overall influenced by rootstocks upon the first harvest. FA13 and C35 induced a breakthrough in color change, while V17 brought about the greatest color increase. CL and V17 initially delayed the fruit maturity index. In the last harvest, while CL had one of the highest maturity indices, V17 exhibited the lowest as acidity was maintained as harvest advanced. The CC and M fruit had the highest and lowest sucrose content, respectively. The highest glucose and fructose contents in fruit were induced by V17, FA5 and CC. The highest citric acid content was displayed by V17 in all the harvests. The FA13, C35 and VK fruit exhibited the highest malic acid content. The effect that rootstock exert on ascorbic acid and flavonoid content depends on the studied season.

Enzyme loading was 10 mg protein/g dry substrate and 40 U/g of β-glucosidase (F10) activity. SCB was efficiently hydrolyzed by B1 host after alkaline pretreatment, yielding glucose and reducing sugars at 71 g/L or 65 g/100 g of dry pretreated substrate and 91 g/L or 83 g/100 g, respectively. B1 host performed better also for EFB, regardless of the pretreatment method, but yields were lower (glucose 27–30 g/L, 25–27 g/100 g; reducing sugars 37–42 g/L, 34–38 g/100 g). SBH was efficiently saccharified by the combination of B1 host and B1-XylA, yielding similar concentrations of reducing sugars for both pretreatments (92–96 g/L, 84–87 g/100 g); glucose recovery, however, was higher with alkaline pretreatment (81 g/L, 74 g/100 g).

The soil samples were collected from two fields under maize: one week (Ist sampling time) and six months (IInd sampling time) after fertilization. The laboratory experiment included determination of: catalase activity, dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass, and basal respiration; pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also measured. The silty Luvisol was characterized by higher biological activity than the sandy Arenosol. Biofertilizer addition to degraded soils increased the biological activity, even in reduced doses of additives used; however the responses of the tested microbiological indicators were different. Soil texture affected the positive biomass response to biofertilizers which was observed in samples from Ist sampling time in silty soil, while from IInd sampling time in sandy soil. Based on our results, we propose that Polifoska with microorganisms (used in full dose) may be optimal for silty soil. Polifoska (in reduced dose) and urea (both in full and reduced dose) may be recommended for sandy soils. Increasing pH was a stronger driver of soil biological activity than DOC.

Here, we use a next-generation sequencing-based Diversity Array Technology sequencing (DArT-seq) technique to analyze Polish gene bank accessions that originated from wild populations and cultivars. The major and, also, the most astounding result of our work is the low level of observed heterozygosity of individual plants from natural populations, despite the fact that the species is widespread in the studied area. Inbreeding in naturally outcrossing species such as valerian decreases reproductive success. The analysis of the population structure showed the potential presence of a metapopulation in the central part of Poland and the formation of a distinct gene pool in the Bieszczady Mountains. The results also indicate the presence of the cultivated gene pool within wild populations in the region where the species is cultivated for the needs of the pharmaceutical industry, and this could lead to structural and genetic imbalances in wild populations.

Water deficit and heat stress both significantly reduce the yield of grain legumes, and the faba bean is considered particularly susceptible. The genetic improvement of faba bean for drought adaptation (water deficit tolerance) by conventional methods and molecular breeding is time-consuming and laborious, since it depends mainly on selection and adaptation in multiple sites. The lack of high-throughput screening methodology and low heritability of advantageous traits under environmental stress challenge breeding progress. Alternatively, selection based on secondary characters in a controlled environment followed by field trials is successful in some crops, including faba beans. In general, measured features related to drought adaptation are shoot and root morphology, stomatal characteristics, osmotic adjustment and the efficiency of water use.

It was revealed that pre-sowing treatment with B. subtilis 10–4, SA, and B. subtilis 10–4 + SA, both under normal and combined drought conditions, notably reduced (by 50–80% or more) the incidence of FRR development in wheat plants, with the most notable effect for B. subtilis 10–4 + SA (wherein disease symptoms were almost absent). Moreover, B. subtilis 10–4, SA, and especially B. subtilis 10–4 + SA increased plant growth (root and shoot length, fresh and dry biomass) under normal (up to 20–50%), drought (up to 15–40%), FRR (up to 15–30%), and combined drought + FRR stresses (up to 20%), with the maximum effect for B. subtilis 10–4 + SA. Additionally, B. subtilis 10–4, SA, and B. subtilis 10–4 + SA decreased stress (drought, FRR, and combined drought + FRR)-instigated lipid peroxidation and osmotic damages of plant cells. The findings indicate that endophytic bacteria B. subtilis 10–4 alone and in a mixture with SA may be used as an effective eco-friendly agent to improve wheat growth and tolerance under the influence of drought, FRR, and combinations of these stresses.

During the winter months in the greenhouse production industry, the supplemental lighting required to keep up production levels results in high expenditure. Current technology uses broadband high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps, which is not the most efficient light source for crop production. Recent breakthroughs in the development of light source technologies have led to new opportunities for the use of sustainable and highly efficient light sources in the form of LEDs (light-emitting diodes) for greenhouse lighting. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of using photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) light for cucumber yielding, production processes and its influence on the variable costs in the cultivation of cucumbers using three different types of lighting. The research was carried out using three individual greenhouse growing area compartments, whereby the plants contained within were lit using three combinations: 1. HPS standard illumination from top HPS sodium lamps—control, 2. HPS-LED—HPS toplighting and LED interlighting, and 3. LED-LED—100% LED lighting, both toplighting and interlighting with LED. The research was conducted in two independent winter crop cycles. The results of the research conducted indicate that the efficiency of light use was the highest in the LED-LED combination and the lowest in HPS, and the use of supplemental lamp lighting in the LED-LED combination (interlighting and toplighting) gives the most favorable surplus of all the variable costs over the value of production to be obtained. Despite the highest absolute level of variable costs in this type of supplemental lighting, the production value was higher by as much as 32.55% in relation to the HPS combination, which also translated into a gross margin that was higher by about ¾. However, it is worth pointing out that, in the HPS-LED combination, the share of lighting and heating costs in the total value of production was the lowest. It is also a combination currently recommended in the literature as being the most beneficial in greenhouse production.

It is known for its good adaptation to different weather conditions, although it performs best in a warm and humid climate. Since the yield and various quality characteristics of vegetables are known to be strongly influenced by a number of weather, agronomic, and genetic (variety/cultivar) factors, in this study we aimed to compare three cultivars of courgette (Atena, Lajkonik and Soraya) grown in two consecutive growing seasons in the organic and conventional agronomic systems. The concentrations of nitrates, nitrites, carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, β-carotene) and chlorophylls (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b) in courgette fruits were analyzed by HPLC. The growing season had a predominant effect on the yield as well as the majority of the analyzed compositional parameters of the courgette fruits. The studied cultivars differed significantly in the concentration of lutein, β-carotene, and chlorophylls, although some significant interactions between the cultivar and the growing season were observed. On average, organically grown courgettes were characterized by a significantly higher yield, as well as higher dry matter and chlorophyll content, however, this agronomic system’s effect was not consistent among all the studied cultivars in the two seasons. The study suggests that organic practices have a potential to provide high yields of good quality crops, comparable (or, in the case of some parameters, better) than the conventional, resource-intensive horticulture.

Therefore, this research aims to study the impacts of moderate (MS), and high (HS) severity burn on N transformation and N losses, compared to an unburned (C) during the first year. The experimental plots (10 m2) were established in Croatia (43°58′ N 15°31′ E), in a slope ~18°, with a southwest exposition. Five days after the burn, C treatment had a significantly higher total N (TN) than MS and HS. Generally, the runoff was significantly different between burned and C treatments. Sediment yield, concentrations, and TN loss were significantly higher in MS than in C treatment. The concentrations of ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) in the runoff, and their losses were higher in burn treatments than in C treatment. These values were high in the first three months after burn, although the peaks in later periods correspond to extreme rainfall events. Principal component analysis showed that sediment yield was associated with sediment concentration, runoff, and TN loss (Factor 1). In addition, rainfall amount and intensity were inversely related to NH4-N concentration and losses (Factor 2). The NO3-N concentration was positively related to NO3-N losses. Overall, MS treatment had severe effects on N loss and, sediment yield can be used as an indicator of soil degradation after pile burns.

Using conventional crossings and the embryo-rescue techniques the following interspecific hybrids were developed: 11 genotypes of F1 generation, 18 genotypes of F2 and F1 × F2 generations (produced after self- and cross-pollination of interspecific F1 hybrids), 10 plants of the BC1 generation (resulted from crossing head cabbage cytoplasmic male-sterile lines with interspecific hybrids of the F2 and F1 generations) and 8 plants of BC1 × (F1 × F2). No viable seeds of the BC2 generation (B. oleracea) were obtained due to the strong incompatibility and high mortality of embryos. The morphological characteristics during the vegetative and generative stages, pollen characteristics, seed development and propagation, nuclear DNA contents and genome compositions of interspecific hybrids were analyzed. All the interspecific F1 hybrids were male-fertile with a majority of undeveloped and malformed pollen grains. They showed intermediate values for morphological traits and nuclear DNA contents and had nearly triploid chromosomal numbers (27 to 29) compared with parental lines. The F2 generation had a doubled nuclear DNA content, with 52 and 56 chromosomes, indicating their allohexaploid nature. F2 hybrids were characterized by a high heterosis of morphological characteristics, viable pollen and good seed development. F1 × F2 hybrids were male-fertile with a diversified DNA content and intermediate pollen viability. BC1 plants were male-sterile with an intermediate nuclear DNA content between the F2 and head cabbage, having 28 to 38 chromosomes. Plants of the BC1 × (F1 × F2) generation were in majority male-fertile with 38–46 chromosomes, high seed set, high heterosis and intermediate values for morphological traits. The obtained interspecific hybrids are valuable as new germplasm for improving Brassica-breeding programs.

In the present study, a field trial was conducted using a randomized complete block design with four replicates to elucidate the effects of vermicompost application (compared to supplementation with chemical fertilizer and no fertilizer) on the productivity of ex vitro MD2 pineapple plants. Vermicompost was applied on the sandy loam soils at transplanting followed by a second application at 7 months after planting (MAP) at the rate of 10 t·ha−1, while chemical fertilizer was applied based on the recommended cultivation practice. Data analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the plants treated with vermicompost and chemical fertilizer in terms of the plant height, number of leaves, length and width of D-leaves, stomatal density and stomatal size. However, the fruits produced with vermicompost amendment were smaller in size but contained higher total soluble solids, titratable acidity, total solids, ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll content compared to the fruits produced from plants supplied with chemical fertilizer. Based on the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays, the methanolic fruit extracts from the control plants showed the highest antioxidant potential, followed by those of plants treated with vermicompost and chemical fertilizer. On the other hand, the application of vermicompost reduced soil acidity and produced macro- and micronutrient contents (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, B and Al) in the soil and plants that were comparable to or higher than those produced by the chemical fertilizer treatment. However, some of the nutrient contents observed in all treatments were lower than the recommended range for pineapple plant growth, suggesting that vermicompost or chemical fertilizer should not be used alone as a source of nutrients for ex vitro MD2 pineapple plants under these soil and field conditions. However, vermicompost can be used as a supplement to increase the fruit chemical quality and maintain the soil quality for agricultural sustainability.

However, the amount and diversity of these compounds in each fruit specimen depend on its genotype and on a number of environmental factors. This work describes the quantitative ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode-array (UHPLC-PDA) analysis of the capsinoids content in four varieties of pepper (‘Habanero’, ‘Habanero Roxo’, ‘Bode’, and ‘Malagueta’) grown until different development stages in a greenhouse under controlled conditions. In all the varieties analyzed, capsiate was the only capsinoid found. The accumulation of capsiate, in all the pepper varieties, started from the 10th to the 20th day post-anthesis (dpa), and increased during the first days (between the 20th and the 27th dpa). From that moment a drastic reduction took place until the end of the ripening stage, except for ‘Bode’ peppers, where the capsiate content increased from the first harvest point on the 20th dpa up to the 76th dpa. The capsiate accumulation patterns over the development of the fruit has been related to the capsaicionoids accumulation patterns in the same samples of the four varieties of pepper. According to our results, the content evolution of both families of compounds will vary depending on each fruit’s genotype, as well as on environmental conditions. No clear trends have been established and, therefore, an in-depth analysis under controlled conditions should be carried out.

They can significantly improve plant growth and development likely through nutritive and/or biostimulant mechanisms. In nursery production chain of tomato, pepper and melon, the use of seven CTs was evaluated in order to substitute, totally or partially, chemical treatments with propamocarb-hydrochloride (47.3%) and fosetyl-Al (27.7%), a fungicide for the pathogenic oomycetes control. In general, CTs increased plant growth parameters, as suggested by measurements of root length (+9.1% and +8.1%, on average, on tomato and pepper, respectively), stem diameter (+12% on average, on tomato), number of leaves (+2.6% on average, on melon), and fresh biomass (+8.2% on average, on melon) in comparison with the chemical control. CT from artichoke and fennel composted residues have had the major impact on nursery performances of tomato, pepper and melon. After the first treatment of the polystyrene trays with the fungicide at sowing, our results indicated that CT may replace it in the following seedling production cycle, securing vegetative characteristics of nursery plants similar to the chemical control, that may incite fast starting of transplants in the field stage.

Nevertheless, this sustainable practice has been only recently used for table grape viticulture, with results often contrasting. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a fescue (Festucaarundinacea Schreb.) cover crop on soil quality, yield, and grape qualitative parameters in a table grape vineyard (cv “Italia”) located in southern Italy, comparing results with the conventional tillage. Soil organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), microbial biomass C (MBC), β-glucosidase (BGLU) and alkaline phosphomonoesterase (APME) activities were assessed during three growing seasons (2012–2014) and three phenological stages. The trend of soil chemical and microbiological properties was jointly influenced by the soil management system, growing season and phenological stage. Compared to conventional tillage, cover crops increased, on average, soil organic C, total N, MBC, BGLU and APME by 136%, 93%, 112%, 100% and 62%, respectively. Slight or no effects of cover crops were observed on grape quality and yield, except for 2012 (the driest season), when a yield reduction occurred. This study reveals that cover crops strongly enhance soil quality in the short-term, with potential advantages for grape production in the long-term.

Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effect of two biostimulants on the bean yield and fiber fractions in seeds: neutral-detergent fiber, acid-detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. The field experiment performed in 2016–2018 in Poland. Over the growing season, plants were treated with biostimulants seaweed extracts (concentrations of 0.7% and 1%) and amino acids (0.3% and 0.5%) based products. Plants were sprayed a single time in the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt and Chemical industry (BBCH) 13–15 phenological phases and a double spray in the BBCH 13–15 and 61. The study showed a significant increase in bean yield (average 32.08% compare to control) when seaweed extracts was used in the form of a double spray at a higher concentration. In the case of the application of amino acids-based product, the best results (increase of 21.97%) were obtained using a double spray at a lower concentration. It was found that the tested biostimulants changed the fiber fractions of bean seeds. The acid-detergent fiber (ADF) content was the highest (average increase of 2%) after double plant treatment with seaweed extracts based product. While the increased concentration of neutral-detergent fiber (NDF) (over 4%) resulted from double spraying with lower concentration of this biostimulant. The increase in the lignin (ADL) (1.12%), hemicellulose (HCEL) (4.54%), and cellulose (CEL) (0.91%) represented plant response to the double application of this biostimulant in the higher concentration. The results indicated also that the use of amino acids-based product caused an increase in the ADF (0.28%), NDF (10.27%), ADL (0.63%), and HCEL (9.99%) contents in bean seeds as an effect of double plant treatment with this biostimulant at lower concentration.

Five supplemental light emitting diode (LED) light intensity (LI) treatments provided canopy-level photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) ranging from 41 to 180 µmol m−2 s−1. With a 12-h photoperiod, the treatments provided 1.76 to 7.72 mol m−2 d−1 of supplemental light. Two cultivars of cut gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii H. Bolus ex Hook.f) were used to evaluate vegetative growth and flower production. Plugs of ‘Ultima’ were assessed for vegetative growth and rate of flower development. There were minor LI treatment effects on number of leaves and chlorophyll content index and flowers from plants under the highest versus the lowest LI matured 10% faster. Reproductively mature ‘Panama’ plants were assessed for flower yield and quality. ‘Panama’ flowers from the highest LI treatment had shorter stems than the three lowest LI treatments, and flowers from the middle LI treatment had larger diameter than the other treatments. Flowers from the lowest LI treatment had lower fresh mass than the three highest LI treatments. There were linear relationships between LI and numbers of flowers harvested, with the highest LI treatment producing 10.3 and 7.0 more total and marketable flowers per plant than the lowest LI treatment. In general, increasing levels of supplemental light had only minor effects on vegetative growth (young plants) and size and quality of harvested flowers (mature plants), but flowers from plants grown under higher LIs were more numerous and matured faster.

However, there are areas occupied by agriculture and woodlands with an essential role in provisioning food and other services such as water and climate regulation. The objective of this work was to assess the effect of long-term land use and soil management practices on peri-urban soils in Zagreb (Croatia). Samples were collected at depth 0–10 cm within intensively tilled cropland (CROP) and vineyard (VINE), traditional grass-covered orchard (ORCH), and forest (FOR). The results showed that bulk density was significantly higher in VINE and CROP than in ORCH and FOR. The opposite dynamic was observed in water-holding capacity, air-filled porosity, aggregate stability, organic matter, and soil organic matter stocks (SOCS). Soil water infiltration was higher in FOR plot compared to the other plots. Overall, land-use change had a substantial impact on soil properties and SOCS, especially in CROP and VINE soils. Tillage, pesticides, and fertilizer applications were presumably the reasons for altered soil quality properties. Intensively used areas (VINE and CROPS) may reduce soil ecosystems services such as the capacity for flood retention and C sequestration.

In the context of farm-to-door mode, the fresh retailers could incorporate the postharvest maturity time, picking time and distribution time to deliver high-quality fruits to consumers. This study selects climacteric tomato fruits and formulates a postharvest maturity model by capturing the firmness and soluble solid content (SSC) data during maturing. A joint picking and distribution model is proposed to ensure tomatoes could arrive at consumers within expected maturity time windows. To improve the feasibility of proposed model, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is designed to obtain solutions. The results demonstrate that the joint model could optimize the distribution routing to improve consumer satisfaction and reduce the order fulfillment costs. The proposed method provides precise guidance for tomato online retailers by taking advantage of postharvest maturity data, which is conducive to sustainable development of fresh e-ecommerce.

The role of roots in supporting these goals has been largely ignored. With the increasing need to produce more food, feed, fiber, and fuel on less land and with fewer inputs, the next advance in plant breeding must include greater consideration of roots. Root traits are an untapped source of phenotypic variation that will prove essential for breeders working to increase yields and the provisioning of ecosystem services. Roots are dynamic, and their structure and the composition of metabolites introduced to the rhizosphere change as the plant develops and in response to environmental, biotic, and edaphic factors. The assessment of physical qualities of root system architecture will allow breeding for desired root placement in the soil profile, such as deeper roots in no-till production systems plagued with drought or shallow roots systems for accessing nutrients. Combining the assessment of physical characteristics with chemical traits, including enzymes and organic acid production, will provide a better understanding of biogeochemical mechanisms by which roots acquire resources. Lastly, information on the structural and elemental composition of the roots will help better predict root decomposition, their contribution to soil organic carbon pools, and the subsequent benefits provided to the following crop. Breeding can no longer continue with a narrow focus on aboveground traits, and breeding for belowground traits cannot only focus on root system architecture. Incorporation of root biogeochemical traits into breeding will permit the creation of germplasm with the required traits to meet production needs in a variety of soil types and projected climate scenarios.

The developed control strategy is based on a PI (Proportional-Integral) controller combined with feedforward compensators to improve the performance against measurable external disturbances such as outside air temperature, solar radiation, and wind velocity. Since the greenhouse process dynamics is very complex and physical non-linear models are mathematically complicated, a system identification methodology was proposed to obtain simpler models (high-order polynomial and low-order transfer functions). Thus, an easier procedure was completed to tune the PI controller parameters and to obtain the feedforward compensators expressions by following a series of modern and simple tuning rules. Simulations with real data were executed to compare the control performance of a PI controller with or without the addition of feedforward compensators. Moreover, real tests for the developed control strategy were carried out in an experimental greenhouse. Results demonstrate an enhanced control performance with the presence of the feedforward compensators under different weather conditions.

They provide numerous ecosystem services (ES), but their supply may be negatively affected by agricultural management. We conducted a literature review to identify which ES are supplied by kettle holes and to analyze feedbacks with agricultural management. Taking Germany as a test case, we also analyzed how kettle holes are addressed in policy documents and for which ES they are regulated. This was done to identify the societal value officially associated with kettle holes. The literature review found eight ES attributed to kettle holes, of which hydrological cycle and flood control, chemical condition of freshwaters, nursery populations and habitats and biotic remediation of wastes were addressed most often. In contrast, only the provision of habitat service was addressed in German policy documents related to kettle holes. We identified types of agricultural management that negatively affected the supply of ES by kettle holes, in particular artificial drainage, high levels of pesticide and fertilizer application, and management where tillage and erosion result in elevated sediment inputs. Additionally, climate change may lead to an increased drying up of kettle holes. Based on our finding, we conclude that the intensity of agricultural management around kettle holes threatens the supply of all ES while only the service of providing habitats for biodiversity is addressed in German policy regulations. Further regulation is required to induce agricultural management change towards a conservation of all ES supplied by kettle holes.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the genetic diversity of 162 early maturing white and yellow tropical maize inbred lines, and to determine the population structure, heterotic groups and inter-trait relationships among the lines. Using 9684 DArT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, a gene diversity (GD) of 0.30 was recorded for the inbred lines with polymorphic information content (PIC) ranging from 0.08 to 0.38. The genetic relatedness among the inbred lines evaluated revealed six different groups based on the history of selection, colour of endosperm and pedigree. The genotype-by-trait (GT) biplot analysis identified inbred 1 (TZEI 935) as outstanding in terms of combined heat and drought (HD) tolerance with the base index analysis identifying 15 superior inbreds in the HD environment. A wide range of genetic variability was observed among the inbred lines, indicating that they are an invaluable resource for breeding for HD tolerance in maize breeding programmes, especially in West and Central Africa.

Plants have developed specific mechanisms that perceive the stress signals and respond to external environmental changes via different mitigation strategies. Abscisic acid (ABA), being one of the phytohormones, serves as an important signaling mediator for plants’ adaptive response to a variety of environmental stresses. ABA triggers many physiological processes, including bud dormancy, seed germination, stomatal closure, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of stress-responsive gene expression. The site of its biosynthesis and action must be clarified to understand the signaling network of ABA. Various studies have documented multiple sites for ABA biosynthesis, their transporter proteins in the plasma membrane, and several components of ABA-dependent signaling pathways, suggesting that the ABA response to external stresses is a complex networking mechanism. Knowing about stress signals and responses will increase our ability to enhance crop stress tolerance through the use of various advanced techniques. This review will elaborate on the ABA biosynthesis, transportation, and signaling pathways at the molecular level in response to drought stress, which will add a new insight for future studies.

Conventional methods such as salt-leaching or application of soil amendments, or nature-based solutions (NBSs) such as phytoremediation, have been widely adopted with contrasting results. The use of cyanobacteria for improving soil conditions has emerged as a novel biotechnological tool for ecosystem restoration due to the unique features of these organisms, e.g., ability to fix carbon and nitrogen and promote soil stabilisation. Cyanobacteria distribute over a wide range of salt concentrations and several species can adapt to fluctuating salinity conditions. Their application in agricultural saline soil remediation has been demonstrated, mostly in laboratory studies, but there is a lack of research regarding their use in natural ecosystems restoration. In this article, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on cyanobacteria in the context of ecosystem restoration. Examples of the application of cyanobacteria in alleviating salt-stress in plants and soils are presented. Furthermore, we acknowledge gaps regarding the extensive application of cyanobacteria in salt-affected soils remediation and discuss the challenges of NBSs in salt-affected soils restoration.

Alkalinity and the high affinity of clinoptilolite zeolite (CZ) for macronutrients could improve pH, nutrient availability, and papaya productivity on peat soils. A one-year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of CZ on: (i) soil ammonium, nitrate, P, and K, and (ii) growth, yield, and fruit quality of papaya grown on a peat soil. Treatments evaluated were: (i) different amounts of CZ (25%, 50%, 70%, and 100% of the existing recommended rate of CZ) + NPK fertilizer, and (ii) NPK fertilizer alone. The peat soils with CZ improved pH, ammonium, nitrate, P, and K availability because of the sorption of these nutrients within the structured framework of the CZ. Co-applying CZ (70% to 100%) and NPK fertilizers improved the NPK contents in papaya leaves and the growth, yield, and fruit quality of papaya because of the significant availability of ammonium, nitrate, P, and K in the peat soil for their optimum uptake by the papaya plants. Ability of CZ to buffer the soil pH reduced the need for liming. It is possible to use CZ to improve papaya productivity because CZ can regulate nutrient availability.

While the developing countries of the world face many challenges regarding food security due to rapid population growth and limited agricultural resources, this study aimed to assess the soils of Sidi Barrani and Salloum using multivariate analysis to determine the land capability and crop suitability for potential alternative crop uses, based on using principal component analysis (PCA), agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (AHC) and the Almagra model of MicroLEIS. In total, 24 soil profiles were dug, to represent the geomorphic units of the study area, and the soil physicochemical parameters were analyzed in laboratory. The land capability assessment was classified into five significant classes (C1 to C5) based on AHC and PCA analyses. The class C1 represents the highest capable class while C5 is assigned to lowest class. The results indicated that about 7% of the total area was classified as highly capable land (C1), which is area characterized by high concentrations of macronutrients (N, P, K) and low soil salinity value. However, about 52% of the total area was assigned to moderately high class (C2), and 29% was allocated in moderate class (C3), whilst the remaining area (12%) was classified as the low (C4) and not capable (C5) classes, due to soil limitations such as shallow soil depth, high salinity, and increased erosion susceptibility. Moreover, the results of the Almagra soil suitability model for ten crops were described into four suitability classes, while about 37% of the study area was allocated in the highly suitable class (S2) for wheat, olive, alfalfa, sugar beet and fig. Furthermore, 13% of the area was categorized as highly suitable soil (S2) for citrus and peach. On the other hand, about 50% of the total area was assigned to the marginal class (S4) for most of the selected crops. Hence, the use of multivariate analysis, mapping land capability and modeling the soil suitability for diverse crops help the decision makers with regard to potential agricultural development.

We examined the effects of exogenous gibberellic acid (GA3) on the reproductive phenology, fruit number, yield, and fruit quality of three blackberry cultivars (‘Natchez’, ‘Navaho’, and ‘Ouachita’) grown under subtropical climatic conditions in two consecutive growing seasons. A single spray application of GA3 at 0 or 49 g·ha−1 was performed when plants were dormant in late December to late January. Exogenous GA3 advanced the onset of budbreak by 12 to 82 days, flowering by four to 20 days, and fruit ripening by 0 to 15 days. When pooling across the cultivars, it also increased early-season yield by 83% to 276% in two consecutive growing seasons and total-season yield by 60% in the second growing season. Among the cultivars, the yield responses to GA3 were most consistent in ‘Ouachita’, with early-season yield increasing by up to 499%. The average berry weight and soluble solids concentration were slightly reduced by GA3, but these reductions were not consistent in the two growing seasons and the impact on overall fruit marketability was small. These results suggest that exogenous GA3 is an effective bud dormancy breaking compound for blackberry, and it could be an important adaptation tool for subtropical blackberry production.

The total fluorescent intensity of soil DOM in the EMH system was significantly higher than the values in CM and EM systems. Additionally, the five normalized excitation–emission area volumes from regional integration analysis increased in the order CM < EM < EMH. In comparison with CM and EM soils, the hedgerow significantly increased the evenness of the bacterial communities in the EMH system, whereas no differences were found for the alpha-diversity of eukaryotic communities. The composition of soil microbiota was significantly distinct among the three farming systems, with a hedgerow-specific effect on bacterial community and a management-specific effect on eukarya. The predicted functional profiles indicated that the hedgerow showed a higher contribution to the dissimilarity of bacterial functions. Furthermore, the distinction of the soil microbiota was modulated by the soil DOM composition and significantly positive correlations between the microbiota involved in nutrient cycling and soil DOM were observed. The findings in this work strengthen our understanding of the different responses of bacterial and eukaryotic communities under the long-term ecological management and highlight the beneficial roles of hedgerows in increasing organic matter and modulating community assembly.

To improve productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) under deficit irrigation, an effective water-saving technology that is characterized by three planting modes has been developed (uniform with 30-cm row spacing (U), double-double row spacing of 5 cm (DD), and furrow-ridge row spacing of alternated 20 cm and 40 cm (F)) combined with three irrigation regimes (50 mm water each at growth stage 34 (GS34) and GS48 (W1), and 100 mm water at GS48 (W2), or 100 mm each water at GS34 and GS48 (W3)). Results showed that DD increased yield by 9.7% and WUE by 12.6% due to higher soil water status and less soil water depletion and evapotranspiration compared with U. Although the soil water status, soil water depletion, evapotranspiration, and yield increased with increasing irrigation amount, more soil water depletion and evapotranspiration resulted in low WUE. The deficit irrigation was beneficial for improving WUE as W1 had significantly increased yield by 5.4% and WUE by 7.1% compared with W2. Yield and evapotranspiration showed a quadratic dynamic equation indicating that yield increased with increasing evapotranspiration. Considering WUE and relatively higher yield under deficit water, W1 combined with DD is suggested to be a good management strategy to be applied in winter wheat of water-scarce regions.

One of these elements is nitrogen, which is a major nutrient affecting crop production worldwide. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the impact of various EOM treatments (with and without mineral fertilization) on wheat yield characteristics and the dynamics of mineral nitrogen release. This study was conducted as a pot experiment using three soils characterized by different physicochemical properties, which were collected from the Polish–Czech Republic transboundary area. A spring wheat (the Tybalt cultivar) was selected as the model test plant. The EOMs tested in the experiment included three soil amendments (animal meal, industrial compost, and digestate) characterized by different potential impacts on plant growth and development. The efficiency of the selected amendments was analyzed in two doses, set at 50% and 100% mineral nitrogen ratios (equivalent to 70 and 140 kg ha−1, respectively). The content of mineral nitrogen (N-NH4+ and N-NO3−) in soils before sowing and after harvesting, and the quality and biomass of the wheat yield were determined. The application of an entire N rate in the form of EOM did not cause any decrease in the wheat yields or a clear diversification of the wheat biomass. However, the appropriate selection of rates and fertilizer combinations resulted in an increased amount of available nitrogen being introduced into the soil (a 9–31% and 17–38% increase of N-NH4+ in soils before sowing and after harvesting, respectively, and a 4–63% and 10–34% increase of N-NO3− in soils before sowing and after harvesting, respectively), which resulted in an increase in grain weight, reflecting yield and grain quality (from 2% to 12% higher grain weight compared to the control). The applied EOMs were characterized by readily transforming forms of organic nitrogen into N-NH4+ and further increasing the speed of its conversion into N-NO3−, indicating the capacity of these treatments to act as substitutes for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers.

Recent reports of the toxicity of MB to arthropod pests suggest that MB may be a useful alternative insecticide. The present study assessed the effects of a sublethal concentration of MB (LC30, 0.22%) on the life history and reproductive characteristics of the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover, in both a treated parental generation (F0) and untreated progeny (F1). MB treatment significantly decreased longevity and fecundity in both the F0 and F1 generations, and prolonged the developmental duration of each immature instar of the F1 generations, compared with controls. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), and net reproductive rate (R0) of the F1 generation were significantly reduced, compared to controls. The mode of action of MB is not known, but in aphids treated with LC30 MB, the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) decreased by more than 65%, compared with untreated controls. AChE activity was rapidly inhibited within 1 h, and remained inhibited for 6 h after in vivo exposure to MB. Moreover, molecular docking analysis revealed that MB had a strong affinity with the catalytic site of AChE, with a binding energy value of −6.2 kcal/mole. Our results suggest that MB targets AChE, and that a sublethal dose of MB can have adverse transgenerational effects on cotton aphids.

Bacillus velezensis strain PEA1 was isolated, characterized, and evaluated for antifungal and antiviral activities against Fusarium oxysporum MT270445 and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) MN594112. Our findings proved that strain PEA1 had intense antagonist activity against F.oxysporum. Under greenhouse conditions, the antiviral activities (protective, curative, and inactivation) of PEA1-culture filtrate (CF) on Datura stramonium plants were assayed, using a half-leaf method. The inactivation treatment exhibited the highest inhibition rate (97.56%) and the most considerable reduction of CMV-CP accumulation levels (2.1-fold) in PEA1-CF-treated plants when compared with untreated plants (26.9-fold). Furthermore, PEA1-CF induced systemic resistance with significantly elevated transcriptional levels of PAL, CHS, HQT, PR-1, and POD genes in D. stramonium leaves after all treatments. Gas chromatography‒mass spectrometry analysis showed that pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione is the main compound in the PEA1-CF ethyl acetate extract, which may act as an elicitor molecule that induces plant systemic resistance and inhibits both fungal growth and viral replication. Consequently, B. velezensis can be considered as a potential source for the production of bioactive compounds for the management of plant diseases. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the antiviral activity of B. velezensis against plant viral infection.

Accordingly, interest has been increasing concerning its possible cultivation within protected environments through adoption of soilless cultivation technologies. The aim of the present study was to optimize nutrient solution features in the soilless cultivation of saffron corms. The trial was conducted in a greenhouse at Almeria University. Saffron was grown in 15-L pots filled with perlite. Three fertigation treatments were used, obtained by a linear increase of all nutrients of one standard in order to reach an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2.0 (control, EC2.0), 2.5 (EC2.5) and 3.0 (EC3.0) dS·m−1. Measurements included determinations of shoot length, corm yield, as well as nutrient uptake from the nutrient solution and concentrations within plant tissues. The nutrient solution with the highest EC (EC3.0) allowed obtaining three to five times more corms above 25-mm diameter. The increasing EC had a significant effect on the increase of macronutrient uptake, except for NO3− and NH4+ and resulted in a general increase of nutrient concentrations in tissues, such as corms and roots. Both macronutrient uptake and accumulation in plant tissues were highest under EC3.0. Nutrient uptake was significantly correlated with production of larger corms due to higher horizontal diameter.

The soil showed very high pseudototal and bioavailable concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), due to improper lead-acid batteries storage. Compost amendment in combination with the two biostimulants produced the best outcomes in terms of plant growth and nutrient uptake. The same mix of beneficial microbes improved soil biological fertility enhancing soil nitrogen fixing and ammonia oxidizing bacteria, while reduced the pore water and NH4NO3 extractable concentrations of Cd and at lower extent of Pb in soil. Accordingly, the lower mobility and bioavailability of Cd in soil determined a lower uptake and accumulation of Cd in shoots of different grass species. Our results suggest that a green cap with turfgrass assisted by biostimulants and compost amendment in PTE-contaminated industrial sites could be a reliable and effective practice to protect and restore soil biological fertility and to reduce the risk of PTE dispersion in the surrounding environment.

The objective of this study was to optimise sample preparation and calibrations to improve the accuracy of EDXRF for soil tests. Methods of sample preparation were compared by calculating the recoveries of 13 elements in four International Soil-Analytical Exchange (ISE) standards prepared as loose powder (LP), pressed pellet (PP), and pressed pellet with wax binder (PPB). A matching library (ML) was created and evaluated against the fundamental parameters (FP) calibration using 20 ISE standards. Additionally, EDXRF results of 41 tillage soils were compared with Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) results. The PPB had most recoveries within the acceptable range of 80–120%; conversely, PP yielded the poorest element recoveries. For the calibration, the ML provided better recoveries of Ni, Pb, Cu, Mg, S, P, and Cr; however, for Zn, and Mn, it had the opposite effect. Furthermore, EDXRF results compared with ICP-OES separated by soil texture class for Al, K, Mn, and Fe. In conclusion, the EDXRF is suitable for quantifying both trace elements and macronutrients in contaminated soils and has the potential to provide screening or prediction of soil texture in agriculture.

Drought and soil salinity, especially, are major causes of reduction of crop yields and food production worldwide. It is not unexpected, therefore, that the study of plant responses to abiotic stress and stress tolerance mechanisms is one of the most active research fields in plant biology. This Special Issue compiles 22 research papers and 4 reviews covering different aspects of these responses and mechanisms, addressing environmental stress factors such as drought, salinity, flooding, heat and cold stress, deficiency or toxicity of compounds in the soil (e.g., macro and micronutrients), and combination of different stresses. The approaches used are also diverse, including, among others, the analysis of agronomic traits based on morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical studies, and transcriptomics or transgenics. Despite its complexity, we believe that this Special Issue provides a useful overview of the topic, including basic information on the mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance as well as practical aspects such as the alleviation of the deleterious effects of stress by different means, or the use of local landraces as a source of genetic material adapted to combined stresses. This knowledge should help to develop the agriculture of the (near) future, sustainable and better adapted to the conditions ahead, in a scenario of global warming and environmental pollution.

However, the increased farming operation times that often occur under large-scale farming conditions necessitate shortening the duration of rice growth, especially that of late-season rice; therefore, rice cultivars with short growth durations are popular under such conditions. A field experiment using two short-duration rice cultivars (SRCs), i.e., Jiuliangyou 3 and Shengyou 9520, and two long-duration rice cultivars (LRCs), i.e., Shengyou 957 and Tianyouhuazhan, was conducted in the late season in Yongan and Santang, Hunan Province, China in 2017 and 2018. The grain yield and yield attributes were compared between the SRCs and LRCs, showing that the SRCs, which exhibited an 11–12-day shorter growth period, revealed similar grain yield to the LRCs. The SRCs also exhibited a 10–31% higher spikelet filling rate and a 13% higher harvest index than the LRCs. Moreover, the biomass accumulation, crop growth rate, and apparent radiation use efficiency of the SRCs were significantly higher than those of the LRCs during the postheading phase. Our results indicate that the higher spikelet filling rate, the harvest index, and the apparent radiation use efficiency of the postheading period were the underlying factors for the SRCs’ grain yield.

However, the nutrient uptake phenomenon has not been related well to the soilless culture system. Herein, we report on the design, theoretical analyses, and verification of a method for an online indicator related to plant nutritional aspects. Models for simulating nutrient and water transport in a porous medium were constructed for analyses of the nutrient uptake estimation method. In simulation analyses, we summarized the theoretical relationships between flow rates of total nutrients in a substrate and nutrient uptake. For concept validation, we conducted a greenhouse experiment for correlation analysis with the growth of tomato plants, conventional nutrient, and water management indicators, and developed online indicators related to plant nutritional aspects. Onsite application of the indicator showed a higher correlation with tomato yield than conventional management indicators, such as transpiration, irrigation, drainage ratio, leaching fraction, and electrical conductivity of drainage. In addition, to assess the usability of a nutrient uptake indicator as an onsite decision-making technique, data normalization was conducted. Through this, the time series responsiveness of a nutrient uptake indicator to the yield change was confirmed.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of rootstocks on yield and fruit quality of Mandared, a triploid pigmented mandarin. To do so, we established a rootstock field trial on a high pH soil (8.6) in which Mandared was grafted onto 11 rootstocks. These included some standard rootstocks, such as trifoliate orange ((Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.), Troyer citrange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. × P. trifoliata), Swingle citrumelo (Citrus paradisi Macf. × P. trifoliata), and C35 citrange (C. sinensis × P. trifoliata), as well as new releases from the Council for Agricultural Research and Economics (CREA, Acireale, Italy) and the University of California Riverside (UCR). The cumulative yield was measured over five consecutive years, while fruit quality was analyzed for two years. The trees on C35, C57 (Citrus sunki Hort. ex. Tan. × P. trifoliata), and C22 (C. sunki × P. trifoliata), started to set fruits one year earlier than the others. The trees on C57 provided some of the highest cumulative yields and canopy volumes. The production of Mandared grafted onto C57 was double that of Mandared grafted onto Troyer, while Mandared grafted onto C35 and C22 resulted in the best yield efficiency. The trees on Swingle and C57 significantly reduced the pre-harvest fruit drop, to which Mandared is particularly sensitive. However, grafting Mandared onto Swingle resulted in the highest variation among replicates, probably due to its high sensitivity to iron chlorosis. Most of the fruit quality parameters, such as fruit size, total soluble solids (TSS), and acidity were not significantly different among the rootstock treatments. However, fruits produced by Mandared grafted onto C22 had one of the highest rates of anthocyanin accumulation. The results indicate that C57, C35, and C22 were the most suitable rootstocks for Mandared in South-Eastern Sicily.

The aim of the three-year field experiment was to determine the efficiency of fertilization with a new fertilizer available on the Polish market and containing nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) in proportions designed for cereals cultivation (30% N and 6% S as ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate). Other treatments included no fertilization; fertilization with ammonium nitrate (34% N); fertilization with standard nitrogen and sulfur fertilizer with N supplementation with ammonium nitrate. Nitrogen doses were 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha−1. Sulfur was applied in doses of 30, 40, and 50 kg S ha−1. A beneficial effect of using fertilizer containing N and S in proportions designed for cereals cultivation was observed. The highest mean optimal nitrogen dose and maximum winter wheat yield were recorded for the new fertilizer (217 kg N ha−1 and 8251 kg ha−1, respectively). Sulfur supplementation with the new fertilizer significantly increased apparent nitrogen recovery (mean values 48.9%, 44.6%, and 40.6% for doses 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha−1, respectively), agronomic efficiency (11.1 and 8.6 kg kg−1 N for doses 200 and 250 kg N ha−1, respectively), and physiological efficiency (24.7 kg kg−1 N for dose 200 kg N ha−1).

The impact of agriculture on the environment varies depending on farming practices. The aim of the study was to assess and compare the environmental effects of the life cycle of winter wheat cultivation in three soil tillage systems: conventional tillage, reduced tillage, and no-tillage. The study was conducted in 2015–2017 on 15 agricultural farms located in the Wielkopolska region, Poland. The “cradle-to-farm gate” life cycle of wheat production was analysed using life cycle assessment methodology. The values of impact category indicators, especially in the case of global warming potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential, depended mainly on mineral fertilization. Wheat production generated more adverse emissions with increased nitrogen fertilization both in reduced tillage and no-tillage systems on the studied farms, and consequently resulted in a more negative impact on the environment compared to wheat cultivated in the conventional tillage system. After nitrogen fertilization, use of fossil fuel, and phosphorus and potassium fertilization were the top contributors to environmental impacts of winter wheat production in different tillage systems. The pre-production phase associated with the agricultural means of production was dominant in determining the analysed environmental impacts, except for global warming potential and photochemical ozone creation potential, which depended mainly on the production phase on the farm. The other key environmental impacts that should be considered when it comes to improvements in the life cycle of wheat production were depletion of mineral resources and acidification.

A hypothesis was formulated that the type of growth substrate (vermiculite, silty clay loam or sandy loam soil) and the cultivar affect the phytotoxic potential of MPEO on maize (Zea mays L.). The pot experiments assessed the effect of varying doses of MPEO or maltodextrin, a carrier of microcapsules, mixed with the growth substrates, on maize’s emergence and early growth. The morphological analyses were supported by the measurements of total phenolics in the second leaf and roots. The MPEO revealed phytotoxic effects on maize in all of the growth substrates already at a low dose (36.0 g m−2), displayed by the delays of maize emergence, reduced growth, and biomass accumulation. Maltodextrin also caused significant reductions in biomass of maize roots. In conclusion, maize is susceptible to substrate-applied MPEO, the type of substrate and the cultivar of maize, can modify this effect to a limited extent.

Analyses were performed after 0, 3, 6, and 9 months of storage in floor warehouses and silos. We monitored microbial changes based on the quantitative determination of microorganisms using a plate dilution method and qualitative determination of microorganisms, where we identified a particular species of bacteria using the MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Based on the quantitative determination of microorganisms, we found that the total plate counts of microorganisms was higher in malts than in barley grains. The storage period had the greatest impact on the number of coliform bacteria, which gradually increased with the growing months in storage. The number of lactic acid bacteria in barley grains with the growing months in storage and malt produced from them decreased slightly, and the content of the sporulating bacteria in all the samples fluctuated slightly. Differences in the numbers of observed microorganisms were negligible during storage between floor warehouses and silos. In the samples of barleys, the most commonly identified species were Pantoea agglomerans, which was also present in malt samples but did not belong to the dominant species. A diverse species representation appeared in the samples, whereas predominating species belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the consistency of response of two soybean cultivars to three different rates of mineral N fertilization and two seed inoculation treatments with B. japonicum in field conditions over four years regardless of previous B. japonicum presence in the soil. A highly-diversified-over-years rainfall and temperature in the growing season do not allow for a definite statement of the differences resulting from seed inoculation and mineral N fertilization applied separately or jointly in soybean. A high sensitivity of the nodulation process to rainfall deficits was noted, which resulted in a decreased amount of B. japonicum DNA measured in qPCR and dry matter of nodules. ‘Annushka’ demonstrated a higher yield of seeds and protein, higher plants and the 1st pod setting. ‘Aldana’, due to a significant decrease in plant density, produced a higher number of pods, seeds per pod and the 1000 seed weight per plant. Both cultivars responded with an increase in the seed yield after seed inoculation with HiStick, also with an application of 30 and 60 kg N, as well as with Nitragina with 60 kg N.

With global environmental conditions changing, potato clones resistant to variable water supply are needed and identifying them is a major task. Many indices assessing potato tolerance to water deficit have been proposed, albeit none of them takes into account the severity of the stress or the sensitivity of the developmental stage during which the stress occurs. As a result, data obtained on genotypes in one location or season are normally not useful in another location or in a different season. We have developed an index evaluating yield response of potato to water deficit based on the soil tension the genotype was subjected to for the duration of the stress modified by the development stage of the genotype. The sum of the daily values was combined in a stress severity index (SSI). In total thirteen genotypes differing in duration and sensitivity to drought were subjected to four levels of deficit irrigation on two soil types at different development stages over two years. Early drought (early tuber filling) reduced yields up to 95% whereas late drought (late tuber bulking) reduced yields significantly less. SSI depended on the genotypic phenological development and on the soil tension values and ranges between 25 and 3500. The index differentiated genotypic responses well across treatments and soil types, even with these relatively advanced development stages, up to a value of 1000. Beyond 1000, yields were generally reduced by more than 60% and a differentiation between genotypes was not possible anymore. SSI constitutes a method that renders site, location, year, season, and soil type effects comparable for responses of potato clones to soil water deficit. Combining this measure of stress severity with other proposed indices may improve upon their current weaknesses in finding or identifying the underlying traits of drought tolerance in potato.

Anthocyanin mutants, like the pink-fruited cultivar ‘Pink Lemonade’, are valuable resources for investigating anthocyanin biosynthesis in blueberries. In this study, we examined expression of flavonoid pathway genes during fruit development in wild-type, blue-fruited blueberries using quantitative real-time PCR. Expression was also compared between wild-type and the pink-fruited ‘Pink Lemonade’. This revealed significantly lower expression in ‘Pink Lemonade’ than in wild-type of nearly all the structural genes examined suggesting that a transcriptional regulator of the pathway was affected. Hence, we compared expression of three known regulatory genes and found that the gene encoding the transcription factor MYB1 was expressed at a significantly lower level in ‘Pink Lemonade’ than in the wild-type. To validate the capacity of this MYB1 to regulate the transcription of anthocyanin genes in blueberries, a transient expression assay was conducted. Results indicated MYB1 overexpression enhanced anthocyanin production. Comparative sequence analysis between wild-type and mutant MYB1 variants found differences in highly conserved features suggesting a mechanistic explanation for the mutant phenotype. Collectively, the results presented here contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in Vaccinium.

Its rusticity and nutritious value is calling back attention for its reintroduction into Mediterranean rain-fed farming systems. We studied the adaptation of a range of breeding lines in multi-environment field testing in Spain and Egypt, showing wide variation for grain yield. Broomrape (Orobanche crenata) infection appeared as the major limiting factor in both countries. Level of broomrape infection was highly influenced by environmental conditions, being favored by moderate temperatures at crop flowering and rain and humidity after flowering. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis was applied to understand the interaction between genotype (G) and environment (E) on grain yield and on broomrape infection. AMMI analyses revealed significant G and E effects as well as G*E interaction with respect to both traits. The AMMI analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that both, yield and broomrape infection were dominated by the environment main effect. AMMI1 biplot for grain yield revealed Ls10 and Ls11 as the accession with highest yields, closely followed by Ls16, Ls18 and Ls19. However, these accessions showed also lower stability, being particularly adapted to Delta Nile conditions. On the contrary, accessions Ls12 and Ls14 were more adapted to rain fed Spanish conditions.

In this work, wheat insertion site-based polymorphisms (ISBP) markers were set up for genotyping using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM). Polymorphic HRM-ISBP assays were developed for wheat chromosomes 4A and 3B and used for wheat variability assessment. The marker sequences were mapped against the wheat genome reference sequence, targeting interesting genes. Those genes were located within or in proximity to previously described quantitative trait loci (QTL) or meta-quantitative trait loci (MQTL) for drought and heat stress tolerance, and also yield and yield related traits. Eighteen of the markers used tagged drought related genes and, interestingly, eight of the genes were differentially expressed under different abiotic stress conditions.

Naudin) is an ancient and traditional crop in the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, there has been poor interest in assessing snake melon germplasm where its genetic resources have not been surveyed before despite their potential in adaptation to environmental changes. In this study, we assess the genetic diversity of snake melon landraces collected from different Lebanese regions at both morphological and molecular levels. Morphological characterization using a set of 18 descriptors revealed an important phenotypic variability among the landraces studied. Principle component analysis indicated that fruit hair and its consistency, fruit size, and skin color pattern were good criteria for discriminating among landraces. Based on the scatter plot diagram, landraces of snake melon formed five different groups with one being defined as typical var. flexuosus. Ten simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used for the molecular characterization. Fifty-six different alleles were detected, with an average of 5.6 alleles per locus. Polymorphism information content of SSR markers ranged from 0.06 to 0.84 (average 0.38). Cluster analysis based on molecular markers showed high genetic diversity and divided the landraces into five distinct genetic groups, confirming thereby the morphological variability. Findings of this study indicate a significant diversity for the Lebanese snake melon germplasm that must be further conserved and considered in improvement programs of this ancient crop.

However, just like in other woody species, apricot breeding is highly time and space demanding, and this is particularly true for PPV resistance phenotyping. Therefore, marker-assisted selection (MAS) may be very helpful to speed up breeding programs. Tightly linked ParPMC1 and ParPMC2, meprin and TRAF-C homology (MATH)-domain-containing genes have been proposed as host susceptibility genes required for PPV infection. Contribution of additional genes to PPV resistance cannot be discarded, but all available studies undoubtedly show a strong correlation between ParPMC2-resistant alleles (ParPMC2res) and PPV resistance. The ParPMC2res allele was shown to carry a 5-bp deletion (ParPMC2-del) within the second exon that has been characterized as a molecular marker suitable for MAS (PMC2). Based on this finding, we propose here a method for PPV resistance selection in apricot by combining high-throughput DNA extraction of 384 samples in 2 working days and the allele-specific genotyping of PMC2 on agarose gel. Moreover, the PMC2 genotype has been determined by PCR or by using whole-genome sequences (WGS) in 175 apricot accessions. These results were complemented with phenotypic and/or genotypic data available in the literature to reach a total of 325 apricot accessions. As a whole, we conclude that this is a time-efficient, cost-effective and straightforward method for PPV resistance screening that can be highly useful for apricot breeding programs.

Although changes in plant community composition imply changes in soil function, this relationship is not well understood. We investigated the relative importance of environmental (climatic, management and soil) variables and plant functional diversity (PFT composition and interactions) on soil activity and fertility along a climatic gradient. We collected samples of soil and PFT biomass (grasses, legumes, and non-legume forbs) in six extensively managed grasslands along a climatic gradient in the Northern Iberian Peninsula. Variation Partitioning Analysis showed that abiotic and management variables explained most of the global variability (96.5%) in soil activity and fertility; soil moisture and grazer type being the best predictors. PFT diversity accounted for 27% of the total variability, mostly in interaction with environmental factors. Diversity-Interaction models applied on each response variable revealed that PFT-evenness and pairwise interactions affected particularly the nitrogen cycle, enhancing microbial biomass nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, urease, phosphatase, and nitrification potential. Thus, soil activity and fertility were not only regulated by environmental variables, but also enhanced by PFT diversity. We underline that climate change-induced shifts in vegetation composition can alter greenhouse gas—related soil processes and eventually the feedback of the soil to the atmosphere.

It is important to identify the genotypes that can conserve water under drought stress conditions and improve yield. The objective of the current study was to evaluate cotton genotypes for water conservation traits, i.e., high FTSW (Fraction of Transpirable Soil Water) threshold for transpiration. Plants utilize water slowly by declining transpiration at high FTSW and conserving soil water, which can be used by the plant later in the growing season to improve yield. Fifteen cotton varieties were selected based on their differences in transpiration response to elevated vapor pressure deficit (VPD) to study drought responses. Two pot experiments were carried out in the greenhouse to determine the FTSW threshold for the transpiration rate as the soil dried. A significant variation (p < 0.01) in the FTSW threshold values for transpiration decline was observed, ranging from 0.35 to 0.60 among cotton cultivars. Genotypes with high FTSW thresholds also displayed low transpiration under well-watered conditions. Further studies with four selected genotype contrasts in FTSW threshold values for transpiration showed differences (p < 0.05 to 0.001) in gas exchange parameters and water potentials. This study demonstrated that there are alternate traits among the cotton genotypes for enhancing soil water conservation to improve yield under water-limited conditions.

In order to overcome the productivity barrier the Translational Pigeonpea Genomics Consortium (TPGC) was established, representing research institutes from six different states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh) of India. To enhance pigeonpea productivity and production the team has been engaged in deploying modern genomics approaches in breeding and popularizing modern varieties in farmers’ fields. For instance, new genetic stock has been developed for trait mapping and molecular breeding initiated for enhancing resistance to fusarium wilt and sterility mosaic disease in 11 mega varieties of pigeonpea. In parallel, genomic segments associated with cleistogamous flower, shriveled seed, pods per plant, seeds per pod, 100 seed weight, and seed protein content have been identified. Furthermore, 100 improved lines were evaluated for yield and desirable traits in multi-location trials in different states. Furthermore, a total of 303 farmers’ participatory varietal selection (FPVS) trials have been conducted in 129 villages from 15 districts of six states with 16 released varieties/hybrids. Additionally, one line (GRG 152 or Bheema) from multi-location trials has been identified by the All India Coordinated Research Project on Pigeonpea (AICRP-Pigeonpea) and released for cultivation by the Central Variety Release Committee (CVRC). In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups through TPGC is accelerating genetics gains in breeding plots and is expected to deliver them to pigeonpea farmers to enhance their income and improve livelihood.

However, the evolutionary outcomes of recurrent herbicide selection at low rates are far less understood. In this study of a herbicide-susceptible population of Lolium perenne ssp. multiflorum, we assessed the potential for low glufosinate rates to select for reduced susceptibility to the herbicide, and cross-resistance to herbicides with other modes of action. Reduced susceptibility to glufosinate was detected in progeny in comparison with the parental population following three rounds of selection at low glufosinate rates. Differences were mainly observed at the 0.5X, 0.75X, and 1X rates. Comparing the parental susceptible population and progeny from the second and third selection cycle, the percentage of surviving plants increased to values of LD50 (1.31 and 1.16, respectively) and LD90 (1.36 and 1.26, respectively). When treated with three alternative herbicides (glyphosate, paraquat, and sethoxydim), no plants of either the parental or successive progeny populations survived treatment with 0.75X or higher rates of these herbicides. The results of this study provide clear evidence that reduced susceptibility to glufosinate can evolve in weed populations following repeated applications of glufosinate at low herbicide rates. However, the magnitude of increases in resistance levels over three generations of recurrent low-rate glufosinate selection observed is relatively low compared with higher levels of resistance observed in response to low-rate selection with other herbicides (three fold and more).

The rapidly expanding world population demands further enhancement of yield and performance of wheat. Phenotypic information has historically been instrumental in wheat breeding for improved traits. In the last two decades, a steadily growing collection of tools and imaging software have given us the ability to quantify shoot, root, and seed traits with progressively increasing accuracy and throughput. This review discusses challenges and advancements in image analysis platforms for wheat phenotyping at the organ level.

The symbiotic compatibility of selected isolates was investigated using two agronomically important plants, red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.). A high genetic diversity of analysed strains was shown using the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR) method. Most of the strains showed a high similarity to R. leguminosarum in the 16S rRNA sequence. Two strains were identified as Agrobacterium spp. There was a strong positive correlation between fresh clover weight and the number of root nodules and a statistically significant increase in the number of the root nodules in selected strains compared to the negative control. Phenotypic tests and BIOLOG analysis showed the ability of the analysed strains to grow in different experimental conditions (pH = 6–10, 0.5–3% NaCl, different carbon and nitrogen sources), which makes them suitable for application as an agronomically important factor.

Few studies have assessed locally-available substrates in hydrologically variable floodplain environments. We investigated the effects of green and farmyard manures on rice yields, and total soil C and N in the Kilombero floodplain, Tanzania. At both the fringe and the middle positions, five treatments were applied in 2016 and 2017, comprising (1) non-amended control, (2) farmyard manure, (3) pre-rice legumes, (4) post-rice legumes and (5) a combination of green and farmyard manures. Residual treatment effects were assessed in 2018 when rice plots were uniformly non-amended. Depending on the year and the position, organic amendments increased rice grain yields by 0.7–3.1 Mg ha–1 above the non-amended control. Sole green and farmyard manure applications had similar effects on grain yield, while a combination of green and farmyard manure led to a significant increase in grain yield above both the control and sole applications of organic amendments in both years. The contribution from biological N2 fixation by legumes ranged from 4 to 61 kg N ha–1. Despite partial N balances being mostly negative, we observed positive residual effects on the yield of the non-amended rice in the third year. Such effects reached up to 4 Mg ha−1 and were largest with post-rice legumes, sole or combined with farmyard manure. Irrespective of the position in the floodplain, manures significantly increased soil C and N contents after two years, hence enhancing soil fertility and resulting in increased rice grain yields. Comparable benefits may be obtained along the hydrological gradients of other large river floodplains of the region and beyond.

Weedy rice is characterized by a high biological diversity that permits different populations to be identified on the basis of their morphological and physiological traits. This variability contributes to its success in different environments and allows different abiotic stresses, which are intensified by climate change, to be faced. Taller plants, enhanced tillering, seed shattering and the presence of red pericarp, variable hull coloration and awn morphology, linked to a deeper seed dormancy, are some of the traits that help weedy rice to spread in changing environments. The higher phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability of weedy rice make it more able to cope with temperature variations, intermittent water availability, soil salinity, drought conditions and increased CO2 concentrations than cultivated rice. As these abiotic stresses will become more frequent in the future, weedy rice competitiveness may be higher, with a spread of infestations. Thus, the control of weedy rice should be based on an integration of different preventive and agronomic techniques, a sensible use of herbicides and the use of suitable rice varieties.

In this study, commercial hybrids were tested for resistance to Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, and Fusarium verticillioides (kernel and silk channel), as well as their toxin response. One third of the hybrids tested showed a similar resistance or susceptibility to the three pathogens and their toxin response, but there is no proof for their genetic background being the same or different. The performance of the remaining hybrids was highly variable and supports the idea of different genetic regulation. The mean ear rot severity of the kernel resistance was doubled compared with the silk channel resistance data. The ear rot and toxin tests displayed significant positive correlations, verifying the decisive role of resistance in toxin regulation. Several hybrids, termed toxigenic hybrids, showed significant extra toxin production, indicating an additional food safety risk. The toothpick method gave more reliable results and a better differentiation of genotypes. The resistance to different Fusarium spp. in a specific growing region should be analyzed separately in independent resistance tests. Through this, the food safety risks could be better identified. Susceptible hybrids should not be used for commercial production.

Purple corn protein concentrates (PCPCs) were obtained by alkaline extraction at pH 8.0 and pH 10.0, followed by an isoelectric precipitation process at pH 4.0, pH 5.0 and pH 6.0. Proteins and phenolic content of PCPCs was calculated. PCPC antioxidant properties were determined by the ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in vitro method and by the 2,2-azinobis, 3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, (ABTS) in vitro method. Andean purple corn seeds were able to germinate under the germination conditions tested in this study. The higher percentage of germination was of 63.33% at 168 h/25 °C. The PCPCs protein profile was characterized for the presence of six bands with molecular weights of 14.50 kDa, 20.12 kDa, 25.18 kDa, 41.85 kDa, 59.59 kDa, and 65.87 kDa. Germinated PCPC presented a high TPC content with ranges of 605.71–1820.00 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g PCPC dry weight (DW), germinated PCPC/72 h/25 °C presented a higher value of 1820.00 mg GAE/g PCPC, DW.

The experiments were conducted in the years 2009–2012 in Western Poland. Trees were thinned using a chemical agent, ammonium thiosulphate (ATS), at doses of 20 g ATS L−1, 30 g ATS L−1 and 40 g ATS L−1, and by hand, and the results of chemical and hand thinning were compared with those obtained for unthinned trees. The course of weather conditions in winter and during flowering had a significant impact on yield. Chemical thinning is known to be an effective method to regulate fruiting of pome trees, but it can also be successful if applied to cherry trees, as reflected by the alternate bearing index, which was the lowest after applying ATS at a dose of 40 g. ATS treatment improved fruit quality in full crop years. Thinning resulted in, among other things, larger and darker fruit and higher content of total soluble solids and titratable acidity. Treatment with 40 g ATS L−1 significantly stimulated the vegetative growth of trees.

In recent years, the susceptibility of local wheat cultivars has substantially decreased grain yield and quality. Therefore, local breeding projects must be adjusted toward the improvement of LR and SR disease resistances, including genetic approaches. In this study, a spring wheat segregating population of Pamyati Azieva (PA) × Paragon (Par), consisting of 98 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), was analyzed for the resistance to LR and SR at the seedling and adult plant-growth stages. In total, 24 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for resistance to rust diseases at the seedling and adult plant stages were identified, including 11 QTLs for LR and 13 QTLs for SR resistances. Fourteen QTLs were in similar locations to QTLs and major genes detected in previous linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies. The remaining 10 QTLs are potentially new genetic factors for LR and SR resistance in wheat. Overall, the QTLs revealed in this study may play an important role in the improvement of wheat resistance to LR and SR per the marker-assisted selection approach.

The study was based on a 100-year stationary field microplot experiment where the soil profiles were collected with preserving the natural soil horizons. The microplot experiment was carried out on eight different soil types: Brunic Arenosol (Dystric I), Rendzic Leptosol, Fluvic Cambisol, Haplic Cambisol (Eutric), Gleyic Phaeozem, Brunic Arenosol (Dystric II), Haplic Cambisol (Eutric II) and Haplic Cambisol (Dystric). These soils are the most common types of agricultural soils in Poland. Relatively significant correlations with the soil quality, physical parameters and the glomalin-related soil proteins have been found. The study determined the total GRSP (T-GRSP) and easily extractable GRSP (EE-GRSP) levels in soils as well as the soil physical quality index and soil’s microbial biodiversity. The GRSP depended on the type of soil and correlated with S-Index and also was responsible for the unique chemical and physical properties of soils. Soils characterized by the highest T-GRSP content belonged to the group of very good and good soil physical quality characterized also by high biological activity, for which there were strong correlations with such parameters as dehydrogenase activity (DHA), microbial biomass content (MBC), microbial nitrogen content (MBN) and total bacteria number (B). The highest T-GRSP content and higher microbial diversity were found in Gleyic Phaeozem, Rendzic Leptosol and Fluvic Cambisol. The T-GRSP and EE-GRSP content were additionally correlated with the number of AMF spores. Very poor and poor soil physical quality according to S-Index characterized Brunic Arenosol (Dystric I) and Haplic Cambisol (Dystric). This research indicates that a specific edaphone of soil microorganisms and GRSP content may be of great importance when assessing a soil’s quality and improvements in soil health. The abundance of glomalin-producing fungi significantly affects the quality of the soil. This effect is particularly important for agricultural soils are threatened by ongoing land degradation.

The objective of this study was to identify the climatic factors associated with the variation in soybean productivity under the contrasting eco-geographical conditions of the Krasnodar (KR) and Primorye (PR) territories of Russia. An analysis of 424 soybean varieties from the global collection of the N.I. Vavilov Institute (VIR) at experimental stations in KR and PR in 1987–2005 showed that the soybean yields were higher and time to maturity was longer in KR than in PR, while the 1000 seed weight, on average, was irrelevant to the place of cultivation. The agrometeorological regression models of the observations in 1972–2017 of varieties accepted as the standards showed that the yield in PR was positively related to the sum of the temperatures above 10 °C and negatively related to precipitation in October, while in KR it was positively related to the hydrothermal coefficient. The stability of the soybean yield and of the time to maturity were higher in PR than in KR. Under the conditions of increasing temperatures and the absence of reliable trends for precipitation, a lack of moisture becomes a significant disadvantage for soybean in KR, while in PR conditions are improving.

Nevertheless, the fertigation of almond plantations is currently inefficient (50% nitrogen (N) recovery by yields) due to the limited empirical data to support field applications. For precise fertigation in horticulture, we aimed to determine the trees’ actual mineral uptake. We hypothesized that the mineral requirements depend on physiological development and would vary during the growing season as phenology shifts. To investigate this, we tracked the water, N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) mass-balances of almond trees in 1 m3 lysimeters and monitored their physiological performances. By canopy coverage (leaf area index—LAI)) and radial stem growth, we determined that almond trees invest in biomass between April and July (northern hemisphere). Then, for August until November, the almond trees accumulated metabolites and minerals for the succeeding winter dormancy. Annually, almond trees can utilize major N applications (~180 kg h−1) in early summer for vegetative growth, extract P (~50 kg h−1) by mid-summer for metabolic translocations, and accumulate K (>250 kg h−1) in late summer, possibly for osmotic compensations. Converting these realizations for farm conditions requires the further characterization of the mineral availability at the root zone, and the nutritional status of trees, under various field fertigation applications.

Limited information is available on the most suitable testers that allow the selection of yellow endosperm maize inbred lines with good combining ability for resistance to witchweed (Striga hermonthica) and superior agronomic performance in hybrids targeted to areas infested with the parasite. Testcrosses of 30 Striga-resistant yellow endosperm maize inbred lines with three testers having varying levels of resistance to S. hermonthica were evaluated at Abuja and Mokwa in Nigeria under Striga-infested and non-infested conditions in 2018 and 2019. The lines × tester interaction was significant for grain yield under Striga infestation, indicating that the performance lines in testcrosses varied with the testers. The respective average general combining ability effect of lines and testers was 1.5 and 32.4 times greater than the corresponding specific combining ability effects under infestation, showing the greater importance of additive gene action controlling the performance of testcrosses under Striga infestation. The different testers exhibited a different capacity to discriminate among the test lines with the susceptible tester being the least effective. Most of the criteria used to determine the best tester favored the selection of the tolerant and resistant testers as promising candidates to identify superior Striga-resistant yellow endosperm inbred lines for the hybridization and development of resistant hybrids. The results of this study demonstrated that testers with a high frequency of desirable alleles were superior to the tester with a low frequency of favorable alleles in hybrid breeding programs for resistance to S. hermonthica.

Despite a progressive water deficit and significant yield loss, the measurements indicated very minor changes in chlorophyll content or canopy cover. This corresponded well to the insignificant differences in spectral reflectance normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values. On the other hand, we identified the significant and rapid response of fast fluorescence kinetics data following the onset of irrigation. Analysis of parameters showed the main effects of drought were associated with changes in the amplitude of the I–P phase of the OJIP transient, indicating changes at the level of photosystem I and beyond. Statistical analyses identified the integrative parameter performance index PItot as the most sensitive parameter, which well-reflects the differences in responses of the genotypes to water deficit. Our results suggest that focusing on photosynthetic functions detected by the rapid chlorophyll fluorescence records can provide more accurate information on the drought stress level, compared to the structural data obtained by absorbance or reflectance measurements.

It infects many plant species and reduces both the productivity and quality of crops. Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an economically important crop. In order to develop a molecular marker that can be used more conveniently in the development of PM-resistant melon using MR-1 melon resources, the previously reported cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was improved with a length polymorphism PCR marker. Two cleaved CAPS markers—BSA12-LI3ECORI and BSA12-LI4HINFI—associated with BPm12.1, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) corresponding to the PM resistance of MR-1, have been reported. In this study, we found that in the BSA12-LI3ECORI CAPS marker specifically, a 41 bp deletion was present in the PCR DNA region of the MR-1 melon genome. A new marker capable of distinguishing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) length polymorphism was produced using insertion-deletion (InDel) information in this region. This PCR-based InDel marker distinguished the genotypes of PM-resistant MR-1, PM-susceptible Top Mark, and their F1 progeny. These results suggest that this InDel marker could be used to develop PM-resistant melon varieties based on MR-1.

Inducing earlier and abundant flowering in crossing nurseries (involving erect genotypes) is a key objective for cassava and was the subject of this study. Five genotypes with contrasting flowering behavior were grown under dark night (DN) and extended photoperiod (EP) conditions for three seasons. EP was achieved with different red light emitting diodes (LEDs) with 625–635 nm wavelength all night long or through night-breaks. EP reduced height and number of days to first branching, particularly in non- or late-flowering genotypes. A minimum of 0.02 μmol m−2 s−1 was required to elicit earlier flowering in plants illuminated all night. Early results using five genotypes were validated across 116 genotypes planted in a crossing nursery. EP promoted earlier flowering in erect-plant genotypes but reduced the number of branching events in early flowering genotypes to some extent. 50W LED lamps, fixed at 3 m above ground in a 4.5 m grid, proved to be a practical approach to extend photoperiod in breeding nurseries. Night breaks also proved effective, thus opening the possibility of using solar panels where electricity is not available.

Safflower is mainly cultivated in Asia for its use as floret. In Germany, an economically attractive cultivation for floret use would require a mechanization of harvest. In order to develop a mechanical harvesting system, field experiments were conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof of the University Hohenheim in 2017 and 2018. Safflower was harvested with a combine harvester to obtain the florets. Two safflower (i) cultivars were harvested with (ii) three threshing parameter settings on (iii) five harvest dates to evaluate threshed floret yield, dry matter and carthamidin content, and carthamidin yield. Results showed that the maximum threshed floret yield was achieved at the latest harvest date (784.78–1141.76 kg ha−1), while the highest carthamidin contents were observed depending on cultivar on the first two harvest dates (0.53–3.14%). The decisive and resulting amount of carthamidin yield reached its maximum with the Chinese cultivar and the threshing parameter setting P3 between the fourth and fifth harvest date in 2018 (19.05–19.36 kg ha−1). Highest dry matter contents were achieved at the last harvest date (62.67–77.77%). Individual capitula weight and carthamidin content decreased with later harvest dates. Further investigations should clarify whether the individual capitula weight and carthamidin content correlate with each other or are independent of the date of harvest. This could be a decisive criterion for the selection of cultivars for harvesting florets with a combine harvester. Reduced costs of machine harvesting compared to hand harvesting will make the cultivation of safflower for the food coloring industry in Germany more attractive in the future.

This paper analyzes factors underpinning the adoption of improved groundnut varieties among farmers to pave the way for upscaling quality seed used for increased production and commodity business in farming communities. A four-stage stratified sampling was used to collect data from 300 groundnut farmers in seven agro-ecological zones through individual interviews. Secondary data were collected from the literature and the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute at Naliendele centre (TARI–Naliendele). Descriptive statistics and Probit regression model were used for data analysis. The empirical results showed that Johari 1985, Pendo 1998, Naliendele 2009, Mnanje 2009, Mangaka 2009 and Nachi 2015, are the main six improved groundnut varieties used by farmers, with Pendo 1998 having the highest adoption rate (17.1%). In the grain market, four varieties, namely Pendo 1998, Mnanje 2009, Nachi 2015 and Johari 1985, were observed to be highly preferred by grain off-takers. Furthermore, among the adopted improved varieties, Nachi 2015, is observed to be the most consistent high yielding variety, ranging from 1100 kg/ha to 1500 kg/ha in all agro-ecological zones. A farmer’s decision to adopt new varieties is affected by age and gender, farmer group membership, availability of improved seed and seed cost. Overall, male farmers are more likely to adopt improved varieties of groundnut than female farmers. The implications of these findings are also discussed, in particular in the area of policy support.

The potato tuber moths were predicted to appear throughout the country, consistent with the results obtained for potato tuber moths in 96% of the field survey area. In addition, the climatic suitability of potato tuber moths will remain high due to climate change, suggesting a high risk for damage to seasonal potato production from seeding to harvesting.

Common bean was cultivated according to organic or conventional farming practices during spring-summer in two successive years with crop and treatment during the preceding winter as either: (a) organic broccoli, (b) conventional broccoli, (c) organic faba bean used as green manure, or (d) fallow. Common bean was either inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT 899 or non-inoculated, while faba bean was inoculated or non-inoculated with Rhizobium laguerreae VFLE1. Inoculating faba bean with rhizobia enhanced dry biomass production and biological N-fixing ability in both experimental years. Furthermore, organic farming did not restrict the yield of broccoli compared to conventional practices during the first year, while the reverse was the case in the second year, due to reduced soil N availability. Furthermore, green manure enhanced the fresh pod yield in the following organic crop of common bean in both years. The lowest yield was recorded in organically grown common bean when the preceding winter crop was organically grown broccoli in both years. Rhizobia inoculation of the common bean during the first year slightly increased atmospheric N fixation by common bean.

To study the impact of different features expressions and classification methods on cultivar identification, the performance of the feature expressions and classification algorithms affecting the accuracy of cultivar identification was evaluated by image processing techniques. A total of 448 samples of seeds from seven cultivars of sweet corn, namely, Orlando, Beiyasi, Jingketian 183, Jingtian 218, Suitian 1, CT76 and Lilixiangtian, were evaluated. The color, shape and texture features of the seeds were extracted from the images, and the class separability criterion was adopted to evaluate the separability of the features of the embryo side, nonembryo side and both of them combined. The results indicate that the class separability based on the features of the embryo side was higher than that based on the nonembryo side and both of them combined. Based on the embryo-side optical feature data, dimensionality reduction was conducted by two feature selection methods (stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) and genetic algorithm (GA)) and two feature extraction methods (principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA)). Performance evaluation of the feature reductions was conducted by constructing k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), naïve Bayes (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Compared to the PCA and KPCA algorithms, the SDA and GA algorithms were more conducive to the cultivar classification of sweet corn seeds; the critical features selected specifically by the SDA, K-NN, NB, LDA and SVM classifiers achieved the best classification accuracies (81.43%, 82.86%, 90%, and 87.14%, respectively). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the approach for optical feature selection had a more significant effect on the identification of sweet corn seed cultivars than did the classifiers. Therefore, based on the optical images of the embryo side and the key features obtained by the feature selection method, a classification model was constructed for the accurate and nondestructive classification of different sweet corn seed cultivars.

For this, the Polish and Dutch agricultural situations were compared. The intensive animal and vegetable production observed in the Netherlands over the past 20–30 years was found to substantially contribute to the heavy metal input of these systems. Agriculture in Poland is on the brink of a rapid economical and technological push promoted by the recent admission of Poland to the EU. The current low levels of organic fertilization in this country are expected to increase dramatically in the next few years, leading to an increased environmental burden of heavy metals, similar to that observed in the Netherlands. Awareness of the danger of heavy metals to public health is slowly taking hold, as the EU takes up its responsibility regarding the maximum limits of some of these compounds allowed in mineral fertilizers. However, the authors would like to stress that the major contribution of heavy metals arises from the use of organic fertilizers. Proper dealing with this through means of adaptation of feed regimes and/or remediation could both safeguard the yet unpolluted soils in Poland and prove essential to halt the ongoing pollution of soils in the Netherlands.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nTo publish papers that have impact is indispensable for good scientists. It is frequently accepted that the impact factor (IF) of a journal reflects the likelihood of a paper to have impact. Many scientists may then attempt publishing their papers in journals with the highest possible IF. This is relevant for crop scientists as in many cases our hypotheses may be relevant to agronomy/agriculture but the product of our work may be published in the more basic plant science journals, which in general have higher IF than agronomic journals. To test whether agronomic journals may be better vehicles than plant science journals for crop physiological work, I did an analysis of my own publications (only “standard” papers, disregarding reviews) relating their annual citation rates against the IF of the journal in which they were published. The relationship was virtually inexistent, and my most frequently quoted papers were published in agronomic rather than in plant sciences journals. Conversely, restricting the analysis to the papers published within agronomic journals there was a relationship between the record of citations of the papers and the IF of the journals, particularly if the analysis is restricted to the most quoted papers in each journal. I then analyzed the cases of three other well-recognized crop scientists, to check whether the findings with my results were exceptional, and in the three cases results were remarkably similar. Therefore, it seems that the journal IF might be a valuable criterion for choosing the best journal in which to publish our best contributions only when comparing within agronomic journals, but not within combinations of agronomy and plant science journals. This should be also taken into account in evaluation processes when comparing scientists working in related but not identical fields.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nWhole wheat bread represents an important source of dietary fiber and micronutrients such as minerals and vitamins. The decrease of daily B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin and pyridoxine) intake could be connected to a decrease of bread consumption and a greater consumption of refined products. The aim of this work was thus to estimate the variability of thiamine, riboflavin and pyridoxine concentrations in wheat and to evaluate if this variability is conserved from the grain to the bread in order to identify wheat cultivars with high nutritional potential. Extraction and analysis of B vitamins by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) have been carried out for 49 wheat cultivars (46 bread wheat, 1 durum bread, 2 spelts) grown under the same environmental conditions in nursery plots. Based on grain thiamine concentration, nine cultivars were selected to constitute three groups with low, medium and high grain thiamine concentration and the concentration of B vitamins of their corresponding white and reconstituted flours and white and whole breads was determined. Grains showed a high variability for B vitamin concentrations, ranging from 2.60 to 6.13 μg g−1 dry matter (DM) for thiamine, from 0.48 to 1.06 μg g−1 DM for riboflavin and from 1.45 to 3.16 μg g−1 DM for pyridoxine. After milling, 43%, 67% and 20% of thiamine, riboflavin and pyridoxine were recovered in white flour, compared to 80%, 100% and 95% in reconstituted whole wheat flour, respectively. After bread making, the impoverishment in thiamine and pyridoxine was less pronounced in whole wheat bread (−31% and −37% for thiamine and pyridoxine, respectively) than in white bread (−37% and −62% for thiamine and pyridoxine, respectively). In contrast, riboflavin concentration was two-fold higher in bread than in white flour. The genetic variability of B vitamin concentrations was conserved after milling and bread making, especially for cultivars that have high B vitamin concentrations in whole flour. In conclusion, it appears that B vitamin concentrations of cereal products are also under genetic control, and the variability in B vitamin concentrations is an important factor to take into account for wheat selection.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe analysis of the evolution of crop yield reveals a change in grain composition: increases in yield have led to a decrease in the protein to starch or oil ratios. This negative relationship reflects the higher increase of C assimilation compared with N assimilation. For wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), flour protein concentration is the main quality criterion, especially for bread making. Therefore, a critical question for the future is how to manage the relationship between yield and N concentration, where the objective is to increase both the level and stability of yield and N concentration. To answer these questions, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the variations of yield and of its composition. First of all, we need to analyse genetic variability in different environments that allow the identification of genetic sources of variation that can be used for breeding or in more reductionist approaches. In this paper, we used data from controlled environment and field experiments, at canopy and plant level, and at different sink:source ratios to analyse the genetic and environmental relationship between grain productivity and composition. These experiments confirmed the strong negative relationship between grain yield and N concentration. Post-anthesis temperature and water deficit had significant effects on grain yield and protein concentration, but they did not modify the negative relationship between these variables. However, pre-anthesis water deficit decreased the sink:source ratio resulting in a lower intercept, while the slope was unchanged. Nitrogen deficiency also modified the intercept of the negative relationship, but more importantly it decreased the slope three to four-fold. Thus under limiting N conditions, grain N concentration is more sensitive to yield variation than under non-limiting N conditions. Genetic variation of single grain dry mass and of the sink:source ratios had similar effects to the environmental variation. Three major conclusions can be drawn from these results: (1) the negative relationship between grain yield and protein concentration is primarily determined at the stem level; (2) the grain itself is more limiting for starch synthesis than for protein synthesis and (3) overall any increase in yield is followed by an increase of N utilisation and use efficiency.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nCrop simulation models are important tools to enhance our knowledge of plant processes and responses to the environment. The objective of this effort was to re-evaluate the algorithms in CERES-Wheat that simulate grain mass and grain nitrogen concentration, two primary determinants of grain end-use quality. Data from two contrasting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars collected over three growing seasons with varying sowing dates and plant population densities were used in this study. Grain mass was simulated using a source–sink approach. The source was current dry matter production and translocation of stem reserves. The sink was the number of grains and a surrogate for cell division and cell expansion within each grain. Cell division and expansion were functions of temperature stress term and water stress during anthesis. The translocated stem reserves were a function of temperature, stage of plant development, and a measure of the sink demand. The nitrogen concentration algorithm was modified by making the minimum stover (above ground organs, not including the spike) nitrogen a cultivar dependent parameter, which would allow more or less nitrogen available for translocation depending upon the cultivar. It was assumed that there was a linear relationship between the number of aborted grains at the beginning of the linear grain filling period and the increase in grain nitrogen concentration. It was further assumed that an initial grain nitrogen mass at the beginning of the linear grain filling period was equal to the initial grain mass times the simulated actual nitrogen concentration of the above ground biomass. The root mean square error (RMSE) for grain mass for both cultivars was 2.9 and 3.0 mg for CERES-Wheat and the modified model, respectively. The advantage of the modified model is that it does not require a genetic coefficient to simulate grain mass as does CERES-Wheat. The RMSE for grain nitrogen concentration for both cultivars was 4.5 and 3.0 mg N g−1 DM for CERES-Wheat and the modified model, respectively. However, when the mean square error was divided into systematic and unsystematic errors, there were inconsistent results for grain mass and grain nitrogen concentration for the same model with different cultivars indicating a lack of plasticity of response. Incorporating this plasticity into future algorithms of key plant processes and further evaluations of the modified model in other wheat growing regions should be carried out to determine the robustness of these responses.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nEffects of mineral nutrition and temperature on accumulation and composition of protein in wheat grains and on baking quality were studied under controlled environments. Under a moderate temperature regimen of 24 °C days and 17 °C nights (24/17 °C), post-anthesis N:P:K 20:20:20 (NPK) supplied by continuous drip irrigation increased the rate of protein accumulation, doubled flour protein percentage and slightly increased final single kernel weight. In contrast, post-anthesis NPK had almost no effect on rate or duration of protein accumulation or flour protein percentage under a high temperature regimen of 37 °C days and 28 °C nights (37/28 °C). The 37/28 °C regimen shortened and compressed the stages of grain fill, reduced the duration of dry matter accumulation, and reduced single kernel weight by 50%. Rate and duration of protein accumulation in thermal time and total protein per grain at 37/28 °C with or without NPK were similar to that at 24/17 °C in the absence of post-anthesis NPK. Protein percentage was higher for flour from grain produced at 37/28 °C with or without NPK than at 24/17 °C in the presence of post-anthesis NPK. Transcript and protein profiling studies confirmed that the 37/28 °C regimen compressed development without disrupting coordinate synthesis of gliadins and glutenin subunits, although some specific effects of NPK and temperature on relative amounts of individual gliadins and glutenins were observed. Transcript levels for ω-gliadins, α-gliadins and high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) declined at 24/17 °C in the absence of post-anthesis NPK, whereas transcript levels for low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) and γ-gliadins showed little change. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) demonstrated that relative spot volumes for several ω-gliadins, α-gliadins and HMW-GS were lower at 24/17 °C in the absence than in the presence of post-anthesis NPK, whereas the relative spot volume for a major LMW-GS was lower in the presence of NPK. Effects of temperature on relative spot volume were generally smaller than effects of NPK. Compared to the 24/17 °C regimen in the absence of post-anthesis NPK, relative spot volume for some α-gliadins and HMW-GS were higher at 37/28 °C, with or without NPK, and relative spot volume for a major LMW-GS decreased at 37/28 °C. Loaf volume was correlated with flour protein percentage regardless of temperature regimen but mixing tolerance was highest for flour from grain produced under the 24/17 °C regimens with NPK.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nProtein concentration and composition are key components of the end-use value for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain. Although the qualitative composition of the grain is genetically determined, the quantitative composition is significantly modified by growing conditions, and there are important management × genotype × environment interactions. We recently reported a model of grain N accumulation and partitioning for wheat grain. The main assumptions made in this model are: (1) the accumulation of structural/metabolic proteins (albumins-globulins and amphiphils) is sink-driven and is a function of temperature; (2) the accumulation of storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) is supply limited; (3) on the one hand the allocation of structural/metabolic proteins between albumin-globulin and amphiphilic protein fractions and on the other hand the allocation of storage protein between gliadin and glutenin fractions during grain growth is constant. A modified version of this grain model has been coupled with a revised version of the wheat simulation model Sirius99, allowing us to analyze the interactions between the vegetative sources and the reproductive sinks for N at the crop level. The main modifications to Sirius99 concerned the post-anthesis N uptake and remobilisation. After anthesis, the potential rate of crop N uptake was assumed to decrease linearly with accumulated thermal time, and the actual rate of N uptake was limited by the capacity of the stem to store accumulated N. During grain filling the daily rate of N transfer to grain was calculated daily according to the current crop N-status. The coupled model (SiriusQuality1) simulated dynamics of total grain N and of the different grain protein fractions reasonably well. At maturity, measured total grain N ranged from 0.56 to 1.32 mg N grain−1, and the observed and simulated total grain N were well correlated (r2 = 0.82, slope = 1.08) with a mean error of prediction of 0.11 mg N grain−1. The simulated kinetics of crop N accumulation and stem N were closer to the observations with SiriusQuality1 than with Sirius99, in particular during the reproductive stage. At maturity, simulated and observed quantities of albumins-globulins were poorly correlated (r2 = 0.02). Over the 18 experimental cases studied here, the quantity of storage proteins varied more than three-fold, and the observed and simulated quantities of gliadins and glutenins were well correlated (r2 = 0.79 and 0.72, respectively). The simulations of total N and storage proteins accumulation provided by SiriusQuality1 confirmed that accumulation of grain N is overall source- rather than sink-regulated, at least under non-luxury N conditions. SiriusQuality1 provides a simple mechanistic framework that explains environmental effects on grain protein concentration and composition. The next step is to incorporate genetically related model parameters that will portray genotypic differences in protein concentration and composition.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThis paper presents a framework for nutrient management that takes sustainable soil fertility, environmental protection and balanced plant nutrition as starting points, and integrates concepts from plant physiology, soil chemistry and agronomy. The framework is meant as a tool that can be applied even if no local experimental results are known. Saturated soil fertility and ideal soil fertility constitute the bench marks of the framework. Saturated soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil by itself does exactly satisfy the nutrient demand of a crop producing the target yield, provided no nutrients get lost. Ideal soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil in combination with ‘replacement input’ exactly satisfies that nutrient demand. Replacement input is an input equal to the quantity of nutrients removed in harvested crop.\\nSaturated soil fertility is calculated as a function of target nutrient uptake, and ideal soil fertility as a function of target nutrient uptake and recovery fractions of input nutrients. Because the recovery fractions are high for N, low for P and medium for K, the soil is relatively low in N, high in P, and medium in K at ideal soil fertility. The supplies of N, P and K to the crop by soil and replacement input together are well-balanced. The ratio of ideal soil fertility to saturated soil fertility proves to be 0.2, 0.6 and 0.4 for N, P and K, respectively.\\nIn case of nutrient losses, the steady-state soil fertility where nutrient',\n"," 'Abstract\\nHeat stress effects on grain dry mass and quality were studied in spring wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L.). Three cultivars were chosen with respect to heat tolerance: Lavett (genotype 1), selected for temperate growing conditions and two CIMMYT cultivars, Ciano-79 (genotype 2) and Attila (genotype 3), respectively heat sensitive and heat tolerant varieties for warm environments.\\nPlants were grown in pots at two different day/night temperatures (18/13 and 25/20 °C) in climate-controlled glasshouses and exposed to a 3-day heat shock during the grain-filling phase. To investigate its effect on quality and yield the following traits were included: grain dry mass, flour protein concentration, glutenin macro polymer (GMP) fraction, glutenin particle size, and particle size distribution.\\nThe magnitude in which a heat shock during grain filling affects quality and yield depends on the heat tolerance of genotypes and the preceding ambient growth temperature. As expected, the responses to heat varied between and within genotypes; on the one hand grain size and dry mass decreased, on the other hand, protein related traits were improved. In genotype 1 (Lavett) a negative correlation was found between flour protein concentration and grain dry mass. However, in genotype 3 (Attila) flour protein concentration remained quite stable under a wide range of grain dry mass in response to the treatments. Genotype 2 (Ciano-79) showed an intermediate response. These big differences in genotypic response do have a potential significant impact for maintaining quality under adverse conditions.\\nIn all genotypes the effect of heat stress was larger when plants were grown at 18/13 °C compared to 25/20 °C; especially, grain dry mass was decreased while flour protein and GMP protein fraction, GMP quantity, as well as particle size were significantly increased. The results show that genetic differences in stability of quality and yield in wheat under heat stress can be induced by a short heat-shock treatment during the grain-filling phase. It is concluded that an evaluation of quality and yield responses of wheat genotypes to short spells of heat, could considerably be improved by a heat-shock treatment during the early grain-filling phase.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nLutein and its stereo-isomer zeaxanthin, are the major carotenoids of wheat grain and function as antioxidants in plants as well as in humans. Dietary intake and serum levels of these xanthophylls have been correlated with a beneficial impact on the development of cataracts, age-related maculopathy and other degenerative diseases. The objective of the present study was to explore the genetic variability of carotenoid concentration and oxidase activity among cultivated diploid (einkorn, T. monococcum L.), tetraploid (durum wheat, T. turgidum L. subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn.) and hexaploid (bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L.) wheat species and bread wheat varieties. Varietal mix of the three cultivated wheat species and 48 varieties of bread wheat adapted to north-western European conditions were analysed. The carotenoid concentration of the wholemeal flour of the three wheat species was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The extractable activities of lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase, involved in the degradation of carotenoid pigments during the kneading step of bread making, were also determined for the varietal mix of the three cultivated wheat species. For the three cultivated wheat species, lutein was the major carotenoid and only traces of zeaxanthin were detected, confirming previous results obtained for durum and bread wheat. Lutein concentration was significantly different among the three wheat species, and averaged 5.75 ± 0.17, 3.32 ± 0.18, and 1.24 ± 0.17 μg g−1 DM for einkorn, durum and bread wheat, respectively. The LOX activity of the three wheat species was negatively correlated to the total carotenoid concentration, and was 3-times lower in einkorn (11.91 ± 1.56 nkat g−1) than in durum wheat (33.61 ± 1.59 nkat g−1), which was 2.5-times lower than in bread wheat (84.7 ± 7.72 nkat g−1). The peroxidase activity was not significantly different among the three wheat species. Einkorn appears to be a parent of interest for breeding, since it presents a high carotenoid concentration to LOX activity ratio, a selection criteria that predicts an optimal conservation of carotenoid pigments in bread. Total carotenoid concentration of the 48 bread wheat varieties was assessed spectrophotometrically after calibration against HPLC determination. The results show significant varietal variation of the total carotenoid concentration, ranging from 0.43 ± 0.01 μg g−1 DM (cv. Panifor) to 1.74 ± 0.07 μg g−1 DM (cv. Apache). Therefore, grain selection could be used to increase the nutritional value of wheat products.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nFour trials were conducted to study the grain magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) concentrations in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). These trials used different sources of genotypes, including old French landraces, a worldwide germplasm collection and elite breeding lines or modern cultivars, grown in different environments. Mg concentration ranged from 600 to 1400 ppm in modern material, and reached 1890 ppm in some exotic genotypes. There was a negative correlation between grain yield and Mg concentration, but despite this dilution effect enough variability remains useful for selection purposes. Analysis of variance showed high genotype effects and Spearman rank correlations indicated moderate genotype by environment (G × E) interactions, so breeding for high Mg concentration can reasonably be envisaged. Zn concentration generally ranged from 15 to 35 ppm, but increased to 43 ppm in some genetic resources. Variation in Zn was also partly explained by a dilution effect. There was a significant effect of genotype, but also high G × E interactions, which would make direct selection more difficult than for Mg. However, as Zn and Mg concentrations appeared to be positively correlated, Zn concentration should respond favorably to selection for high Mg concentration. Fe concentration ranged from 20 to 60 ppm, and reached 88 ppm in non-adapted material. There were no significant genotype effects, very high G × E interactions, and the trait was poorly correlated to other mineral concentrations. Breeding for high Fe concentration will thus probably prove illusory.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nEcophysiological models of crop growth and development sometimes show unrealistic responses that are attributable to our incomplete understanding of the processes the models attempt to describe. Rapid advances in plant genetics, genomics and biochemistry offer important opportunities for improving representations of key processes of growth and development. Research on incorporation of genetic information in models supports this potential, especially in modelling cultivar performance across environments. This paper reviews progress in using information from genetics, genomics and allied fields in modelling and examines approaches suitable for modelling wheat (Triticum aestivum L. and T. durum Desf.). Efforts to model wheat crops should first focus on the relatively well-understood genetic systems affecting phenology and plant height. A simple gene-based approach using linear equations to estimate cultivar-specific parameters has the advantage that it can easily be implemented in existing wheat models. One requirement is to integrate data on the genetic makeup of wheat cultivars with results from field trials that can be used to estimate genetic effects and evaluate model performance. Concomitantly, modellers should exploit findings from genomics and allied fields on wheat and other plant species in order to improve sub-models of individual processes, using more complex representations of gene action. Advances in these more mechanistic representations require much more detailed and quantitative studies on how gene action varies with specific environmental signals such as temperature and photoperiod.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nOne of the most important tasks of cereal science is to relate end-product quality to genes involved in determining certain attributes of quality. It requires a good understanding of the complex nature of quality that can lead to the proper measurements of these attributes. Most of our knowledge about the ‘genetics of quality’ derives from two different experimental approaches: (i) direct measurements of quality traits on samples with systematically altered chemical composition; (ii) relating quality and chemical composition/genetics of large sample populations using statistical methods. An overview on the recent achievements of these two approaches will be given introducing a novel prediction procedure relating the individual and interactive contribution of high molecular weight (HMW-GS) and low molecular weight (LMW-GS) glutenin-subunit alleles to specific dough parameters and end-product quality attributes. The results shown are based on a statistical investigation of more than 3000 samples covering most of the glutenin alleles and allelic combinations appearing in the Australian bread wheat cultivars.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nWeed emergence models are increasingly necessary to evaluate and design cropping systems.

Agronomy] and is based on sub-models predicting (a) soil environment (climate, structure) resulting from the cropping system and external climate, (b) vertical soil seed distribution after tillage, and (c) seed survival, dormancy, germination and pre-emergent growth depending on soil environment, seed depth, characteristics and past history. In the present paper, the model was evaluated by comparing its simulated output to independent field observations, as a function of sowing/tillage date, seed depth, seed history and characteristics, soil climate and soil structure. The evaluation showed that the survival of the seed bank in top layers was systematically overestimated. In addition, some minor aspects were identified for future improvements, such as the pre-emergent seedling mortality in very compacted soil structures or germination rates of seeds that had not been previously stimulated by light. Despite these few shortcomings, the model simulates the timing and relative importance of the emergence flushes very well; in addition, the actual emerged seedling densities are usually predicted satisfactorily. Consequently, the model can be used to simulate the effects of cropping systems on black-grass emergence.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nNitrogen (N) leaching was analyzed in relation to nutrient use efficiency, N balance, and mineral N content in the soil in different crop rotations. In spring in the field occupied by sugar beet mineral nitrogen content was 87.8±10.9 kg N ha−1 per year, and after harvest there was a decrease to 46.0±15.7 kg N ha−1 per year. In the fields under winter and spring grain crops, these values were 102.6±54 and 80.5±32.8 kg ha−1 per year, respectively in spring, and 76.0±46.1 and 79.6±34.9 kg N ha−1, respectively, after harvest. The highest leaching from the fields where sugar beet and grain crops were grown was from 7.3 to 39 kg N ha−1 per year, compared to 2–17.1 kg N ha−1 per year from fields with perennial grasses in the rotation. The leaching from sugar beet fields was attributed to mineralization of large amounts of organic residues (tops and small roots) left in the field after harvesting. The quantity of organic matter left after harvesting sugar beet was 2480–7270 kg dry matter (DM) ha−1, compared to barley harvest (490–1150 kg DM ha−1) or winter wheat harvest (1890–2270 kg DM ha−1). The most negative N balance during the 5-year period was in the field with perennial grasses with a total of −426 kg N ha−1. The highest positive balance was for the field with sugar beet in the rotation (+174 kg N ha−1). In the field where cereals dominated the surplus of N was +74 kg N ha−1. Agronomic efficiency (AE) calculated as the ratio between DM yield and amount of fertilizer applied was calculated for main crop groups as well as for the investigated crop rotations with different crop structure. For whole rotations the highest AE was for sugar beet (23.4 kg DM (kg N)−1) followed by winter cereals (8 kg DM (kg N)−1), while the spring cereal yield response to N fertilization was equal to zero. The highest yield response (151 kg DM (kg N)−1) was observed in the rotation where sugar beet comprised 40%, grain crops 40%, and grasses 20% of the rotation period. AE was 42.5 kg DM (kg N)−1 in the rotation with 60% sugar beet and cereal plus leguminous grain crops 40% of the rotation and negative in the 100% grain crop rotation. In summary, the lowest environmental impact in terms of N leaching was in the rotation with grasses. AE was highest in the rotations where sugar beet was included and the area of spring cereals was reduced.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nSimulation models of agro-ecological systems are typically written in a manner that precludes reusability of parts of the model without a significant amount of familiarity with and rewriting of existing code. Similarly, replacing a part of a model with a functionally equivalent part from another model is typically difficult. The objective of this study was to develop a method to enable the assembly of simulation models from previously and independently developed component models. Recent advances in software engineering have enabled the development of software applications from smaller parts (called components) on the basis of an abstract decomposition of the relevant domain (called a framework). Based on a requirements analysis of existing simulation models we developed the ModCom simulation framework. ModCom provides a set of interface specifications that describe components in a simulation. ModCom also provides implementations of the core simulation services. The framework interfaces use well-defined binary standards and allows developers to implement the interfaces using a broad range of computer languages. Using this framework, simulation models can be assembled by connecting component models in much the same way that Lego blocks are put together to assemble a house. ModCom thus allows modelers to create models and modeling tools that are easily exchanged (in binary form or source code) with colleagues across the hall or across the globe.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT) has been in use for the last 15 years by researchers worldwide. This package incorporates models of 16 different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes. Over the last few years, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves. Thus, the DSSAT crop models have been re-designed and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances, applications, documentation and maintenance. The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model (CSM) design is a modular structure in which components separate along scientific discipline lines and are structured to allow easy replacement or addition of modules. It has one Soil module, a Crop Template module which can simulate different crops by defining species input files, an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface, a Weather module, and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil, plants, and atmosphere. It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages, ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSAT–CSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes. In this paper, we describe this new DSSAT–CSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components (soil, crop, weather, and management). In addition, the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation. We provide an overview of the hundreds of published studies in which the DSSAT crop models have been used for various applications. The benefits of the new, re-designed DSSAT–CSM will provide considerable opportunities to its developers and others in the scientific community for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems at field, farm, and higher levels.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nSOILPAR 2 is a program for estimating soil parameters.

First introduced in the 1980s as a voluntary management instrument for dairy farmers, the method has since been developed and formalised in the MINerals Accounting System (MINAS) policy instrument. This is designed to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses. As from 2003, MINAS allows a maximum N surplus on grassland of 180 kg N ha−1 on clay/peat soils and 140 kg N ha−1 on dry sandy soils. In 1997, the mean N surplus on dairy farms in the Netherlands was 324 kg N ha−1. Meeting the MINAS loss standards for 2003 was the objective for the farmers participating in the Cows&Opportunities project. Each farm received a tailor-made fertilisation scheme to reduce N losses and optimise N use. Most farms succeeded in realising a lower N loss than planned in their fertilisation schemes. On the experimental dairy farm De Marke the aim is to get the nitrate content in the shallow groundwater below the EU standard of 50 mg l−1 (=11, 3 mg N l−1). Since 1993 the farm has succeeded in realising low N surpluses (1997: 76 kg N ha−1) and low nitrate concentrations (1993–1999 mean: 55 mg l−1). A clear relation was found between N management, as expressed by the N surplus, and nitrate concentration in the groundwater. However, in some years this relation was disturbed. The results show the value of N balance sheets for reducing N losses. From an agricultural point of view, a major advantage of a system such as MINAS is the autonomy it gives farmers to determine how and where they will reduce the N surplus. Using MINAS, however, is no guarantee that a nitrate concentration of 50 mg l−1 will always be achieved.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nSince the pioneering work of C.T. de Wit in the 1960s, the Wageningen group has built a tradition in developing and applying crop models. Rather than focusing on a few models, diversity is its trademark. Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and crop-soil modelling approaches along three criteria. The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with (i.e. potential, water and/or nutrient-limited, and actual production situations including pests, diseases and weeds). Second, models differ as a result of the objectives of model development, and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness. Third, models have at least three potential application domains, i.e. research, education and support of learning and decision making processes.\\nWe describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations. An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL, SUCROS, ORYZA, WOFOST and INTERCOM. Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented, i.e. plant type design, guiding experimental research, education, yield gap analysis, evaluation of manure policies, crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems. We discuss common issues of model verification, model validation, model validity and data requirements, and present information on software implementation, model and software documentation and distribution policy. Finally, we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research.\\nMajor achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include (1) a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes; (2) their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general, also for applications at higher hierarchical levels; (3) a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education, both at undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral level. To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished. At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing, evaluating and designing cropping systems. This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nRice agriculture is not only affected by climate change, but also contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere. In 1989, a major research project was initiated at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines to investigate relationships between climate change and rice production. A second project started in 1993 to investigate, in more detail, mitigation options that could be employed to help reduce CH4 emissions from rice cultivation. An important component of all of this work was the quantification of these interactions between climate change and rice production into simulation models, and their subsequent use to upscale field measurements to national and regional levels. The first project developed such a model to integrate existing knowledge of effects of increased levels of CO2 and temperature on rice growth, and used this to predict the impact of various climate change scenarios on rice production in SE Asia. In the second project, routines describing the dynamics of CH4 production and emission from the soil were linked to a crop simulation model to estimate the effect of different crop management scenarios on national CH4 emissions from various countries in the region. With the recent completion of the second project, it is timely to review this modelling work describing the relationships between the global environment and rice production, a task which we attempt in the present paper. The advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approaches used and other issues relating to the upscaling of field measurements to national and regional levels are discussed. Future research directions in this area are also identified.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nAccumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soils may cause serious problems for soil quality, groundwater and food chains. Based on the databases of the Swiss agricultural statistics and on data from experimental farms, we modelled regional-scale mass balances of phosphorus (P), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) and their uncertainties for a large number of arable and dairy farms in the northwest of Switzerland using the model PROTERRA-S. Large differences in P fertilization characteristics between these farm types were found.

However, the long-term humus N pool dynamics is seldom considered in fertilisation planning, and thus N surpluses in budgets are considered as losses. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of this assumption and investigate how observed data precision affect the precision of model projections. We used available data sets from long-term agricultural field experiments in Sweden (topsoil C and N concentrations, crop yields as well as soil type and climate data) for calculating topsoil C and N mass dynamics. ICBM/2N, a simple C and N soil model (available at: www.mv.slu.se/vaxtnaring/olle/ICBM.html), was used for calculating soil organic matter balances. We parameterised this model for two field trials, and for specific crops, using available data and educated guesses and compared the results with those obtained from the conventional approach, not including humus pool C and N dynamics. In spite of the corrections for bulk densities, etc., the soil carbon measurements were too variable for a critical model validation or a sensitive test of the effects of including pool dynamics. In other words, we had to rely on the model assumptions for the projections and soil data could only be used to obtain general means, e.g., for the whole duration of the experiment. We think this is a general problem, not limited to this data set and model. We also show, at least in principle, how estimates of organic N pool dynamics can be used to produce improved N balance sheets for individual crops. For example, the apparent N use efficiency by sugar beet increased from 58 to 99% when organic N pool dynamics were included.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nA procedure aimed at identifying cropping systems suitable for environmentally sensitive areas has been developed within the framework of a coordinated Italian project. It has been implemented as a DSS software named Multi-criteria Evaluation of Alternative CRopping Systems (MEACROS) which makes it possible for decision-makers to compare different scenarios based on alternative cropping systems. A set of default technical—agronomic, economic, and environmental criteria have been included in MEACROS to allow for the different impacts induced by each scenario. Users can select between the proposed set of criteria and/or in-putting new ones. The software performs concordance analysis, providing preference rankings for the alternatives, based on computed indices and allowing a good sensitivity analysis of weighted values as well as displaying the results in graphic form. Indicative results are presented here in a case study concerning a farm in a flat, sensitive area in Northern Italy.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nInput Output Accounting systems (IOAs) can be used to identify farming practices which are not ‘environmentally neutral’ and thus unlikely to be sustainable in the long term. In an EU sponsored project, European countries were surveyed and over 50 farm level IOAs identified. The subjects covered by the IOAs included nutrients, pesticides, energy, soil/habitat, conservation, wastes (e.g. packaging and tyres) and other items such as veterinary products. Nearly half the IOAs covered more than one subject and nutrient budgets were the most commonly included (91% of the IOAs studied). Looking at the 30 single subject systems, most (26) were nutrients with only three pesticide and one energy based system. In total 50 systems covered nutrients. Overall, where specified, nutrient budgets covered nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in 13 cases, N and P in 12 cases, N only in nine and P only in four cases. The most common indicators for nutrient budgets were calculation of a balance followed by nitrate leached. The method by which indicators were evaluated and presented to farmers varied. Farming sectors were not equally represented with systems for the arable, dairy and pig sectors the most common. Farmers received a detailed interpretation of their results in two thirds of the systems, most commonly related to official limits or targets. Most of the systems were developed to reduce adverse environmental impacts and 65% of the systems were considered by the respondents to have had a positive environmental impact by reducing surpluses or improving waste disposal. Use of five of the systems could lead to a marketing advantage via certified produce with a recognised quality label. Where factual evidence as to effectiveness was available, the benefits varied between subject types (nutrients, energy and pesticides) and between sectors. Farmers’ responses to the systems were generally positive and they appear to be a useful way of raising awareness of environmental problems. However, economic issues need to be considered, if the costs to the farmer outweigh the benefits, uptake will not be sustained. The type and nature of the interpretation is also important as the most successful IOAs in terms of continued use and interest appeared to be those where there was regular technical input from an adviser. Overall IOAs could offer a useful tool for voluntary improvement in agri-environmental performance on topics that are not already strongly regulated. But more studies are needed to ensure that farmers in reality change their behaviour and to develop the use of reference values.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe EC Nitrate Directive (91/676), agreed by the EC Environment Council in 1991, is an environmental measure designed to protect water against pollution caused by nitrate from agriculture. In 2000, the River Ythan catchment, a 68\\u2008000 ha area of predominantly agricultural land in NE Scotland, was designated a nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) by the Scottish Executive. A combination of reasons for designation was suggested, including evidence of elevated nitrate concentrations in the surface waters of the catchment together with the criteria set out at Annex IA(3) of the EC Nitrates Directive, i.e. that the estuary is eutrophic or in the near future may become eutrophic. Evidence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency surface water monitoring sites has revealed several tributaries of the Ythan with nitrate concentrations exceeding the maximum permitted level of 50 mg l−1 (11.3 mg l−1 NO3–N) and a rising trend in the main river channel. There has been an approximate threefold increase in surface water nitrate concentrations since the early 1960s to a current value of ∼35 mg l−1 (8 mg l−1 NO3–N). There is separate evidence of elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater. The amounts of fertiliser N applied annually has also increased substantially and in 1994 these were estimated to be ∼60% of the total N (equivalent to 194 kg ha−1) added to the catchment. Various stages have been involved in the decision to designate including documents for public consultation and a proposed Action Programme. However, several issues remain to be resolved, especially the extent to which a causal relationship actually exists between the increased loss of nitrate to the estuary and algal growth. Being able to accurately apportion sources of N ‘supply’ with periods of ‘uptake’ within the aquatic system is complicated. Here we suggest that an estimated 70% of the terrestrially derived nitrate input to the estuarine system actually occur out with the main period of algal growth. This emphasises the need for a greater understanding of the spatial and temporal linkages that exist between N cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems particularly as this will directly influence the likely success and cost effectiveness of remedial measures taken to relieve the symptoms of eutrophication.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe software irene (Integrated Resources for Evaluating Numerical Estimates) is a data analysis tool designed to provide easy access to statistical techniques for use in model evaluation.

They rely on data that are readily available at farm-gate and field level, and the information generated is easy to communicate to farmers and policy makers. This may have contributed to high expectations on element balances as a tool for optimising agricultural nutrient use efficiency and thereby reducing nutrient losses. Element balances are potentially useful as a screening tool across Europe provided the methods to calculate them are standardised, their limitations and usefulness defined and appropriate target values are established by which they can be compared. It is difficult to establish straightforward relationships between nutrient management, surplus, losses and environmental impact. Simple farm-gate and field balances need to be complemented by a better understanding of the processes regulating nutrient dynamics, and their spatial and temporal variability. Hence, agronomic and environmental reference or target values need to be established for different production systems, geographical areas and elements. Proper instruments and tools as well as training and educational programmes have to be developed for a successful implementation.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe determination of nutrient surplus (fertiliser-offtake) is one of the indicators of potential losses from the agricultural system to the environment and can be applied at different geographical scales, from field to regional. When information is collected from individual farmers, the sample size is usually small as compared to the total number of the farms in a particular area. Official databases, when present, are more objective and contain information on all the farms in the area and as such provide information regarding the variability that exists between farms of a region. A geographical information system was built using all the information available in official databases to estimate soil surface nutrient balances at a regional scale within a 7773 ha area in Northwest Italy, where agriculture is very intensive. The nutrient surplus was calculated for the main farm types. Dairy farms showed the greatest surplus for all nutrients considered with values greater than 320 kg ha−1 for N and K and 110 kg ha−1 for P. Pig livestock farms followed next, with excesses greater than 270 kg N ha−1, 100 kg P ha−1 and 220 kg K ha−1. Cattle livestock farms showed the lowest surplus, compared to the other livestock farms, with values close to 190 kg N ha−1, 80 kg P ha−1 and 230 kg K ha−1. Farms without livestock showed the closest equilibrium between fertilisation and offtake, with a surplus in N, P and K equal to 40, 20 and 70 kg ha−1, respectively. Despite the fact that local legislation only regulates slurry management precisely, it appeared that larger surpluses could be associated to the use of solid manure. Scenario analyses showed that manure exchange between farms in the area could lead to a drastic reduction in the use of mineral fertilisers, but at the regional scale an acceptable surplus can only be attained for N and K, while the excess of P remains a serious problem for the environment. The study indicated where the lack of information appears to be more critical and suggested options for a more accurate and organised acquisition of data. The results can be used for further studies, for instance with the aim of estimating the fate of nutrient surplus in the soil or in the air using simulation models.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nCropSyst is a multi-year, multi-crop, daily time step cropping systems simulation model developed to serve as an analytical tool to study the effect of climate, soils, and management on cropping systems productivity and the environment. CropSyst simulates the soil water and nitrogen budgets, crop growth and development, crop yield, residue production and decomposition, soil erosion by water, and salinity. The development of CropSyst started in the early 1990s, evolving to a suite of programs including a cropping systems simulator (CropSyst), a weather generator (ClimGen), GIS-CropSyst cooperator program (ArcCS), a watershed model (CropSyst Watershed), and several miscellaneous utility programs. CropSyst and associated programs can be downloaded free of charge over the Internet. One key feature of CropSyst is the implementation of a generic crop simulator that enables the simulation of both yearly and multi-year crops and crop rotations via a single set of parameters. Simulations can last a fraction of a year to hundreds of years. The model has been evaluated in many world locations by comparing model estimates to data collected in field experiments. CropSyst has been applied to perform risk and economic analyses of scenarios involving different cropping systems, management options, and soil and climatic conditions. An extensive list of references related to model development, evaluation, and application is provided.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nAgriculture is one of the major sources of nitrogen that contributes to the eutrophication of the inland waters and the Baltic Sea. The results of a 6-year study of three small agricultural catchments (Vienziemite, Berze and Mellupite) and three drainage fields in these catchments indicated that the most important factors of agricultural pollution are acreage of arable crops, farming practices, and nutrient management. In particular, attention was focused on the land use as well as on the effects of the soil nutrient balance. Large variations in N losses (Ntot=2–27 kg ha−1 per year) could be demonstrated. The losses appeared to be smaller than the results under similar cropping systems and soils in the Nordic countries where the measured losses were 20–50 kg ha−1 per year. The most significant increase of nitrogen loss was associated with the large share of arable land and increased fertiliser application in Berze small catchment during the last 2–3 years. The negligible increase of nitrogen leakage in Vienziemite catchment had resulted from the low input agriculture with a negative N balance. The results indicate that the N balance as well as the land use play an important role in the leakage of nutrients from drainage and small catchments.',\n"," \"Abstract\\nThere has recently been a strong tendency for agricultural production in peri-urban areas in southern Vietnam to move away from low input rice production to more intensive fruit and vegetable production, often in combination with pig production. The access to a market has led to increased availability of fertilisers and livestock feed in these areas, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in nutrient inputs. The objective of this study was to describe nutrient management on smallholder farming systems in a peri-urban area outside Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam. Nutrient management was assessed by nutrient balances and flows and the data were gathered through interviews with local farmers, and measurement of inputs and outputs. Nine farms were selected containing one or more of the following production units: pig, crops, and fish. Feedstuffs and fertilisers were important sources of input of N, P and K on the livestock farms. On the farms without pig production, ash constituted on average 77% of all K input, but for N and P, fertilisers were the dominant forms of input. Farm-gate balances for N, P and K were positive on all farms and were in the range 31–868 kg N ha−1 per year, 23–644 kg P ha−1 per year and 9–770 kg K ha−1 per year. The different production units were poorly integrated as nutrient output from one unit seldom matched nutrient demand, as estimated by nutrient output, in the next unit. All pig production units showed similar nutrient use efficiencies, but there were large differences between the crop units, varying greatly both among different crops, and for the same crop, among the farms. The crop units were characterised by large nutrient surpluses and low nutrient efficiencies, indicating a high risk for nutrient losses to the wider environment. The results highlight the farmers' need for better tools to optimise farm nutrient management, both through better integration of the production units, but especially also by improving crop nutrient use efficiency.\",\n"," 'Abstract\\nFor most poor countries of today, using agriculture for development is widely recognized as a promising strategy. Yet, in these countries, investment in agriculture has mostly been lagging relative to international norms and recommendations. Current wisdom on how to use agriculture for development is that it requires asset building for smallholder farmers, productivity growth in staple foods, an agricultural transformation (diversification of farming systems toward high value crops), and a rural transformation (value addition through rural non-farm activities linked to agriculture). This sequence has too often been hampered by extensive market and government failures. We outline a theory of change where the removal of market and government failures to use this Agriculture for Development strategy can be addressed through two contrasted and complementary approaches. One is from the “supply-side” where public and social agents (governments, international and bilateral development agencies, NGOs, donors) intervene to help farmers overcome the major constraints to adoption: liquidity, risk, information, and access to markets. The other is from the “demand-side” where private agents (entrepreneurs, producer organizations) create incentives for smallholder farmers to modernize through contracting and vertical coordination in value chains. We review the extensive literature that has explored ways of using Agriculture for Development through these two approaches. We conclude by noting that the supply-side approach has benefited from extensive research but met with limited success. The demand-side approach has promise, but received insufficient attention and is in need of additional rigorous research which we outline.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThis paper explores how social impact investing (SII)—where financial investments are made with the intention to generate a beneficial and measurable social impact alongside a financial return—is influencing new forms of agricultural development, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The rapid growth of SII is occurring in the context of broader shifts in development towards private-sector led and growth-orientated models. We ask four questions: i) who are the key actors involved in SII in African agriculture (and what motivates their involvement); ii) how is the notion of social impact defined and operationalised; iii) through what practices and narratives is African agriculture specifically constructed as a site for investment; and iv) what are the political-economic implications of the resulting assemblage of actors, metrics and motivations (especially in terms of what and where is rendered investable)? We draw on a cultural political economy approach combining the core interests of political economy (investigating the structures, institutions and power relations of economic processes) with insights from post-structuralist social science into how such economic processes take on particular meanings through historically and geographically specific practices and discourses. We show that SII is driven by commercial interests, shifts in investment in relation to the growth of ethical capitalism, and shifts in philanthropic circles to viewing SII as a mechanism to access alternative sources of funding. SII is thus not simply a tool for creating new sources of funding for existing development activities. It is changing development policy and practice by bringing in new actors (most notably private equity funds and institutional investors); altering the nature and activities of existing actors (for example encouraging philanthropic organisations to blend their activities, rather than simply using investment returns to fund development work); and producing new and uneven geographies of agricultural development.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nClimate-smart agriculture (CSA) is increasingly important for advancing rural development and environmental sustainability goals in developing countries. Over the past decade, the international community has committed billions of dollars to support various practices under the banner of CSA. Despite this effort, however, CSA adoption remains low in many contexts. Lack of conceptual clarity about the range of potential farm-level CSA practices across contexts impedes understanding of CSA adoption in developing countries. Here we review relevant literature to develop a typology of farm-level CSA practices to facilitate analyses of CSA adoption. The typology consists of six categories, organized from least to most resource intensive: (1) residue addition, (2) non-woody plant cultivation, (3) assisted regeneration, (4) woody plant cultivation, (5) physical infrastructure, and (6) mixed measures. We use the typology to generate and test hypotheses about CSA adoption using primary household survey data from a large aid-funded CSA intervention area in southern Malawi. We then use recursive bivariate probit regression (controlling for endogeneity and selection bias) to estimate the effect of program participation on adoption across CSA categories. We find positive and statistically significant effects of program participation on adoption of CSA practices generally with the strongest effects on resource-intensive CSA categories. Results demonstrate the potential for wider application of the typology to build knowledge of the effectiveness of CSA promotion efforts across different social and environmental contexts. Our findings also suggest the importance of external support for the adoption of more resource-intensive CSA practices among rural households and communities in Malawi and elsewhere in the developing world.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nSustained interest by the business community in commercial agriculture in the global South has been welcomed for its potential to bring capital into long neglected rural areas, but has also raised concerns over implications for customary land rights and the terms of integration of local land and labor into global supply chains. In global development policy and discourse, the concept of “inclusive business” has become central in efforts to resolve these tensions, with the idea that integrating smallholders and other disadvantaged actors into partnerships with agribusiness firms can generate benefits for national economies, private investors, and local livelihoods. Scholarly treatment of the topic has tended to be polarized into win/lose narratives, or points to the contingency and social differentiation of localized experiences. This review paper takes a different approach, exploring published evidence on the structural factors shaping agricultural value chains and their implications for social inclusion. We develop a typology of seven agricultural value chains, and use this to select a sample of crops in specific world regions for an analysis of how structural factors in value chain relations - from crop features, to market dynamics and policy drivers – affect social inclusion (and exclusion). Such an approach allows us to ask whether inclusive agribusiness is a realistic goal given the broader structuring of agribusiness and the global economic system. Our study finds that while the characteristics of specific crops and supply chains exert a strong influence on opportunities and constraints to inclusion, the overall trend is towards more exclusive agribusiness as governments scale back support to smallholders, more stringent standards raise barriers to entry, and firms streamline operations to enhance competitiveness. This raises questions about the feasibility of this goal under the current political economic system. Findings point to the need to re-consider the policy choices behind these trends, and how we deploy the fiscal, legislative, and gate-keeper functions of the state to shape agrarian trajectories.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nMalnutrition remains a problem across India, particularly among women and children in rural areas. In response, nutrition-sensitive agriculture (NSA) programs have emerged, which promote activities such as crop diversification, nutrition education, and women’s empowerment. While research has assessed whether NSA programs have an impact on nutrition indicators, less work has examined whether such programs are equitable in distributive, procedural, and recognitional terms. This study investigates how one non-governmental organization (NGO) working through women-led self-help groups (SHGs) in eastern India has incorporated NSA practices into its traditional focus of improving cereal productivity and promoting cash crops. Given that both research sites in northern Jharkhand and eastern Madhya Pradesh have seen agricultural practices shift from more diverse, traditional cropping to high-yielding rice over the past decade, this research examines women’s responses to these new NSA promotion efforts. This 11-month study employed ethnographic methods including participant observation and 117 interviews with village women along with NGO and government workers across both sites. This analysis employed an equity framework based on the decolonial concept of cognitive justice, which asserts that epistemological inequity precedes socioeconomic inequities. The findings suggest while all respondents reacted positively to the tenets of NSA promotion, due to high-yielding paddy’s labor requirements and cultural aspirations to maximize rice production, many farmers (especially those engaged in improved paddy cultivation) were unable to adopt NSA practices robustly. While poorer farmers not growing improved paddy were better positioned to adopt NSA, many were less active in SHG activities due to structural barriers and an observed lack of cognitive justice. As NSA programs are still emerging, little research has detailed the ways such efforts may exacerbate or allay rural inequities. This study suggests NSA could have more impact on cropping practices and nutrition outcomes if it led with an equity approach centered on cognitive justice.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThis paper compares national-level data from India with 40 years of household panel data from rural India to track sectoral changes in employment and income as well as examine the hypothesis of induced innovation in agricultural production. In the national data, India appears to be in the midst of a structural transformation. The share of agriculture in GDP and employment has shrunk while agricultural output continues to grow. This productivity growth appears to adhere to the induced innovation hypothesis, as productivity per hectare has increased more rapidly than productivity per worker. Many of the same patterns exist in the household data. Tracking households across time, I observe agricultural output has increased, despite more households engaging in off-farm labor. Household agricultural production is highly specialized and has increased its reliance on improved inputs. However, while agricultural income has grown, industrial and service income has remained stagnant, and the relative income of these households has declined in recent years.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe sustainable development of Nigeria is being challenged by a persistent large financial inclusion gender gap (FIGG). The same gender gap in the country’s smallholder agriculture frustrates the multifunctional potentials of agriculture in achieving sustainable development outcomes. The smallholders drive the agricultural sector, comprise majority of the worlds’ poor and are found in all regions in Nigeria. This study used a mixed method review from secondary sources (Global Findex Databases 2011, 2014, 2017, Nigeria – CGAP Smallholder Household Survey 2016 and literatures) to investigate the trend in FIGG in smallholder agriculture in Nigeria. The causes and effects of FIGG on sustainable development were also identified by this study and the strategies to bridge the gap. Our study found that the FIGG in smallholder agriculture was 12% in 2016, while considering the whole population; it increased from 7% in 2011 to 20% in 2014 and 24% in 2017. The causes of FIGG were ascribed to socioeconomic, socio-cultural, institutional, legal and regulatory factors which affect the demand and supply of formal financial services. The FIGG in smallholder agriculture has interlinked negative effects like high cost on agricultural productivity, income inequality, food insecurity, limited market access and poverty which retards sustainable development. This study argued that bridging the FIGG in smallholder agriculture through targeted strategies like digital financial inclusion and gender responsive agricultural finance innovations would not only advance efforts aimed at closing the FIGG in Nigeria but would also reposition the country in achieving SGD5 and other sustainable outcomes. Progress made by Nigeria would contribute to African continent’s advancement and also fast track the global realization of the SDGs by 2030 given Nigeria’s highest population in Africa.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe tobacco alkaloid myosmine was detected in nut and nut products [J.

NNN is a strong oesophageal carcinogen in rats. Metabolic activation of NNN leads to formation of DNA and protein adducts which release HPB upon hydrolysis. In the present study the time, pH and dose-dependent nitrosation of myosmine and its covalent binding to DNA was investigated. [5-3H]myosmine was incubated with nitrite for 1−24 h in buffer solutions adjusted to pH 1−6. At pH 2−4 myosmine was easily nitrosated and gave rise to two major products, HPB and NNN, and five minor not yet identified products. Maximal formation was achieved for HPB at pH 2 after 8 h (72% of total radioactivity) and for NNN at pH 3 after 8 h (16%). For DNA binding studies labeled myosmine was incubated under nitrosation conditions with calf thymus DNA. Within 3 h up to 0.1% of the radioactivity was covalently bound to DNA. Endogenous nitrosation of myosmine, present in nuts and other dietary components could constitute a significant risk factor for tumours in the upper intestinal tract such as oesophageal adenocarcinoma, which are unrelated to tobacco smoking and alcohol abuse.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nGene flow between coexisting oilseed rape varieties and rape volunteers cannot be solely studied on field experiments.

In the present work, the model was improved to simulate simultaneously the spread of three different genes. Four different regions were then surveyed from 1995 to 2001: one region comprised only farmers’ fields with frequent rape crops in the rotations; the three remaining regions comprised the French experimental GMO platforms with 2–3 GM and one non-GM rape variety as well as neighbour farmers’ fields. For all these fields, cropping history was recorded during the study and for at least three previous years. In the first region, rapeseed volunteers were assessed in crops as well as on road and field margins in 1 year. In the three remaining regions, volunteer densities and genotypes were assessed each year after harvest and rape harvest genotypes determined during 2 years. The comparison of simulated and observed data showed that the model usually satisfactorily predicts volunteer densities and genotype proportions as well as harvest genotype proportions. Several problem areas were identified: volunteers in road and field margins were usually badly predicted; the model frequently underestimated volunteer densities in spring crops; gene flow via pollen dispersal was underestimated when the distance from the pollen source increased. The model was then used to simulate the spread of herbicide-tolerant rape volunteers in a region grown with one or several GM herbicide-tolerant varieties and more particularly the stacking of several resistance genes in individuals. The simulations also showed the contamination of the harvest of non-GM rape varieties by GM seeds resulting from gene flow.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThis article deals with the interrelation of ecological and economic aspects through the use of indicators. Two aspects are painted out: the first being the measurement of the economic value of ecological services, and the second being the integration of economic aspects into comprehensive indicator systems.\\nThe measurement of the economic value provides a means of determining consumer-orientated values of landscapes and bio-diversity issues. This measurement, however, is viewed critically by some, especially in nature conservancy circles. For them the intrinsic values of a landscape, which cannot be measured in economic terms, play the central role in the assessment of landscapes [Oekonomische Bewertungsgrundlagen und die Grenzen einer ‘Monetarisierung’ der Natur.

Braeuer [Money as an indicator: to make use of economic evaluation for biodiversity conservation. In: Buechs, W. (Ed.), Biotic Indicators for Biodiversity and Sustainable Agriculture. Agric. Ecosyst.

Stress was first considered as an unspecific response to any challenge taxing the organism's resources where the HPA axis plays a central role [Selye H. A syndrome produced by diverse nocuous agents. Nature 1936:32]. Along the same lines, welfare was considered as the state of an individual on a continuum between poor and good depending on the efforts required to adapt to the environment [Broom DM. Animal welfare: concepts and measurement. J Anim Sci 1991;69:4167–75]. However, these views cannot explain opposite results such as up- vs. down-regulation of the HPA axis and hypo- vs. hyper-behavioural reactivity under chronic stress. Later, it was shown that aversive situations trigger stress responses only if the individual perceives them as aversive. Mason [Mason JW. A re-evaluation of the concept of ‘non-specificity’ in stress theory. J Psychiatr Res 1971;8:323–33] suggested that the unspecificity of stress responses originates from a common emotion that produces them. Welfare has also been defined in terms of emotional states by Dawkins [Dawkins MS. Animal suffering, the science of animal welfare. London: Chapman and Hall Ltd.; 1980] and Duncan [Duncan IJH. Welfare is to do with what animals feel. J Agric Environ Ethics 1993;6:8–14]. Hence, both concepts are linked to mental states. Recent advances in psychology suggest that the very nature of an emotion results from a series of evaluations of the triggering situation that the individual makes based on criteria including novelty, predictability, controllability, and others [Scherer KR. Appraisal considered as a process of multi-level sequential checking. In: Scherer KR, Schorr A, Johnstone T, editors. Appraisal processes in emotion: theory, methods, research. New York: Oxford University Press; 2001. p. 92–120]. It is therefore suggested that the discrepancies found in the literature in terms of responses of the HPA axis or modification of behaviour under aversive conditions may stem from differences in the way a situation is evaluated. It is argued that stress comes from the animal's evaluation of the outcome of a situation, and that welfare is the state resulting from that evaluation.\",\n"," 'Abstract\\nPossibilities for growing dryland lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) productively in drier parts of central-western and western New South Wales (NSW) were investigated by consideration of meteorological records. Annual rainfall data and estimated evapotranspiration data for 1995–1999 were compiled to calculate lucerne growing days and N2-fixing days at Condobolin, Trangie, Cobar and Wentworth. This information was used in conjunction with seasonal indices of dry matter production and nitrogen fixation derived from the work of Bowman et al. [Aust J Exp Agric 42 (2002) 439] at Trangie to estimate yearly biomass production and N2 fixation for the four locations. It was concluded that (i) there are good prospects for growing lucerne productively on suitable soils located in that extensive region of central-western and western NSW between the 450 and 300 mm isohyets if it is feasible to develop techniques for establishment and management to maintain stands at an acceptable density—not less than eight plants/m2, (ii) there are only poor prospects for growing lucerne in those western parts of the state where annual rainfall averages less 300 mm, and (iii) annual rainfall, irrespective of other factors such as erratic distribution, is a rough guide to potential lucerne production. In addition, there were indications that, were the threshold for cessation of lucerne N2 fixation reduced by 2 °C (say from 10 to 8 °C), annual N2 fixation would be enhanced by more than 20%.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe occurrence of seasonal water logging was studied across a small (639 ha) catchment in the south-west of Western Australia. There are two groundwater systems in the catchment, a seasonal aquifer perched on the ‘B’ horizon of a duplex soil, and a deeper, perennial system which upslope is 6–8 m below the surface, but intersects the surface in the valley floor. The perched aquifer causes water logging across about 25% of the catchment. Water logging risk was predicted using a steady state hydrological model (Topog_Simul, [Water Resource Res. 22 (1986) 794]) and a hydrogeomorphic classification [Hydrogeological characterisation of catchments using Hydrogeomorphic Analysis of Regional Spatial Data (HARSD): characterisation of Axe Creek Catchment, Vic., Australia. In: Tanaguchi, M. (Ed.), Subsurface Hydrological Response to Land Cover and Land Use Change. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht] and both models compared favourably with occurrence mapped from air photography. The patterns of water logging occurrence also compared well with simulations using a dynamic catchment model (Topog_Dynamic, [Modelling drainage and transient water logging in an agricultural catchment. In: Proceedings of the 25th Hydrology and Water Resources Symposium and 2nd International Conference on Water Resources and Environment Research, Brisbane, 6–8 July 1999. Water ’99. Publ. Inst. Eng. Aust., p. 999; Agric. Water Manage. 39 (1999b) 283]). The dynamic modelling showed that the impact on transient water logging of an existing drain and tree system in the catchment is only local to the area of the trees and drains, and does not contribute in a major way to the transient water logging further down the slope. However, this modelling, as well as long-term groundwater simulations (FlowTube, [Calibration and modelling of groundwater processes in the Liverpool Plains. CSIRO Land and Water Technical Report 5/00.]), showed that over time the trees would help lower groundwater relative to the “do nothing different” scenario. The long-term modelling also showed that a substantial portion of the catchment would have to be planted in order to have a major impact on groundwater discharge at the valley floor, and hence on salinity of both the soil and the stream.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nOyster thermal properties and applications of thermal transfer to oyster shucking are discussed. Oyster shell thermal conductivity varied from 0.9 to 2.27 W/m °C, depending on the study and oyster used [Gomez-Martinez, O., Zambrano-Arjona, M., Alvarado-Gil, J.J., 2002. Imaging of subsurface defects in bivalve shells by photothermal techniques. Materials Research Society, Material Research Society Symposium Proceedings, vol. 711. Merida, Mexico; Tulshian, N., Wheaton, F.W., 1986. Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell thermal conductivity: technique and determination. Trans. Am. Soc. Agric. Eng. 29 (2) 626–632]. Oyster shell density varied from 1710 to 1940 kg/m3 (Tulshian and Wheaton, 1986). Releasing the oyster shell bond appears to be possible using heating or freezing. Heating is a more reliable method of shucking than freezing but the heat must be applied to the shell exterior over the muscle–shell bond without unduly heating the shell edges. Heating was applied using a water bath, white and filtered visible light, and infrared irradiation. Freezing was accomplished by an alcohol–dry ice bath, a household freezer, and by direct expansion of Freon-12. Thermal conductivity of the shell limits the usefulness of heating temperatures over 400 °C because the time to sever the muscle–shell bond is an exponentially decreasing function.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe purified dioscorin from yam (Dioscorea alata L. cv. Tainong 1) tuber was previously reported (Hsu et al., 2002. J. Agric. Food Chem., 50, 6109–6113). In this report, we evaluated its immunomodulatory ability in vitro in the presence of polymyxin B (50 μg/ml) to eliminate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination. Dioscorin (5–100 μg/ml) was able to stimulate nitric oxide production (expressed as nitrite concentrations) in RAW264.7 cells. The stimulation index on the phagocytosis of RAW264.7 cells against E. coli and the oxidative burst (determined by the intensity of rhodamine fluorescence) of RAW264.7 cells were both enhanced by different concentrations of dioscorin (5–100 μg/ml). The cytokine production, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in dioscorin-treated RAW264.7 cells or human monocytes, was measured in the cultured medium. Dioscorin (5–100 μg/ml) was found able to induce IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β production in RAW264.7 cells and human monocytes. To evaluate the effects of dioscorin on the proliferation of spleen cells from BALB/c mice, phytohemagglutinin (PHA, 2 μg/ml) alone or PHA mixed with different concentrations of dioscorin (10, 25, and 50 μg/ml) was used to treat spleen cells for 24 h. The stimulated proliferation index of splenic cells ranged from 1.38- to 1.48-fold of PHA alone for PHA mixed with different concentrations of dioscorin (10, 25, and 50 μg/ml). We suggest that the tuber storage protein of yam dioscorin functions as an immunomodulatory substance.',\n"," \"Abstract\\nWater has been labelled ‘blue gold’, and ‘blue gold’ is destined to be the critical issue of the 21st Century. Globally, irrigation is responsible for 80% of the world-wide spending of ‘blue gold’.\\nDevelopment of sustainable irrigation practices will require that we understand better the biophysical processes of root-water uptake in soil, and transpiration from plant canopies.\\nOur review paper is divided into four parts: models, measurements, knowledge gaps and policy.\\nFirst, we present a retrospective on what has been done with root-water uptake models since the pioneering scheme of Wilford R. Gardner in 1960. His solution for water movement to a plant root was analytical. Since then, nearly all the models calculate water flow using numerical solutions of the Richards’ equation. These schema include a water-uptake term specifically for the distributed uptake of water from soil by the root system. These models fall into two groups based on how the uptake term is handled. The most common formulations, called Type I, have evolved from the work of Gardner [Gardner, W.R., 1960. Dynamic aspects of water availability to plants. Soil Sci. 89, 63–73] and describe the microscale physics of water flow from the soil to, and through, the plant roots. The second form, Type II, comprises macroscopic, empirical functions that describe uptake based on responses to water potential. We discuss the merits and potential of these schemes. Yet, models are data hungry. Effective modeling requires apposite parameterisation to be effective. This can require substantive empiricism.\\nSecond, we present new data on the functioning of root-water uptake and transpiration by kiwifruit vines. We describe new observations in the root zone, obtained using arrays of time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. As well, we present results obtained with new methods of sap-flow measurement inside the kiwifruit vine's roots. These reveal the uptake dynamics during partial root zone drying (PRD), a technique oft-touted to reduce irrigation volumes.\\nNext, we outline future research needs. This includes a requirement to infer better the matric potential at the soil–root boundary and its control on plant transpiration. We suggest that the role of reverse flow and specification of the root resistance also needs more researching. Further, linking the functioning of water uptake with the form of the root system will not be achievable until we know more about root resistance. Canopy area and architecture are critical for controlling transpiration, yet they are tiresome to measure. Improved measurement techniques, preferably remote, would enhance our ability to predict crop water-use and to assess more accurately the need for irrigation [Wesseling, J.G., Feddes, R.A., 2006. Assessing crop water productivity from field to regional scale. Agric. Water Manage. 86, 30–39].\\nFinally, we demonstrate how our scientific knowledge can be used to develop sustainable irrigation practices.\",\n"," 'Abstract\\nAlley-cropping has successively been overestimated and despised, due to unrealistic expectations of this “more natural” type of agriculture and the disappointment thereafter, when the negative effects of trees on crops became evident over time. In this paper we examine the performance and underlying mechanisms of a Calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn.)–maize (Zea mays L.) alley-cropping system on a phosphorus (P) limiting Ferralsol in Western Kenya. The system performance analysis methods of [The ‘dark side’ of intercropping: manipulation of soil resources. In: Sinoquet, H., Cruz, P. (Eds.), Proceedings of the International Conference on Ecophysiology of Intercropping. INRA, Paris, France, pp. 45–66] and [Agric. Ecosyst. Environ. 80 (2000) 87] were used as well as mechanistic research into availability, uptake and balances of below ground resources. The Calliandra–maize system performed worse than sole maize (I=−66%, according to Ong’s method) Calliandra affected the less limiting resource nitrogen (N) positively, but the negative effect of Calliandra on P-availability, the main limitation of the environment outweighed the positive or fertility effect, according to Kho’s performance analysis method. However, after P application, when the main limiting resource for maize in our environment shifted to N, the Calliandra had still only a marginal positive effect on maize yields (insignificant 5% increase of alley-cropping compared to sole maize). This was explained by a negative total N balance in the soil of −30 kg ha−1, and a negative inorganic N balance in the soil of −277 kg ha−1 over the seven seasons. The difference between total and inorganic N balance was due to a mineralisation of only 20% of the N in all the Calliandra mulch applied over the seven seasons. Net negative nutrient balances also explain the general trend of decreasing yields of 40–90% over the seven seasons. We conclude that the combination of Ong’s simple method, Kho’s resource-base explanation and further investigation of long-term supply and availability of the resources that are the main limitation(s) of an environment can give an understanding needed to create productive and sustainable alley-cropping systems.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe drained and irrigated marshes in south-west Spain are formed on soils of alluvial origin from the ancient Guadalquivir river estuary. The reclaimed area near Lebrija, called Sector B-XII (about 15,000 ha), has been under cultivation since 1978. Some years, however, water supply for irrigation is limited due to drought periods. The scarcity of good quality water during the drought period 1993–1995 imposed on farmers the necessity to irrigate with river water, which at this location is saline due to tidal flow. The objective of this work was to determine the composition of the in situ soil solution and exchange complex of the reclaimed soil, of a plot near Lebrija, using the EXPRESO model. One of the irrigations, during the growing season of cotton crop in 1997, was with saline water (EC=22.7 dS m−1). The soil samples (0–0.3 m and 0.3–0.6 m depths) used in this work were obtained during 1997 in a farm plot of 12.5 ha (250m×500 m) situated in an area of marshes on the left bank of the Guadalquivir river, near Lebrija (south-west Spain) [Agric. Water Manage 48 (2001) 133]. The chemical composition of the saturated paste extracts was determined in the laboratory. The electrical conductivity of the saturated paste extract (ECsp) 1 day after irrigation with saline water, for both sampling depths, showed an increase in comparison with the value of the samples taken just before irrigation. One month later, the ECsp reached a similar value to that before irrigation with saline water, due to the three irrigations with fresh water. The in situ soil solution characteristics, simulated by EXPRESO, showed higher values of the different parameters than those of the saturated paste, but with similar trends. ECsp, at 0–0.3 m depth, after irrigation with saline water ranged between 7.87 and 8.15 dS m−1, and in situ values simulated by EXPRESO ranged between 15.1 and 22.4 dS m−1. This means that under field conditions the EC can be up to three times the ECsp. The ESP showed a similar trend to that of the EC. Simulation by EXPRESO of the soil solution and exchange complex composition at the in situ soil water content gives a more comprehensive picture of the soil salinity than the saturated paste extract.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nA user-friendly window based irrigation scheduling model (ISM) developed by George et al. [Agric. Water Manage. 46 (2) (2000) 121] was modified by incorporating a rice irrigation scheduling model and integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) software. The developed rice irrigation scheduling model is based on a daily water balance approach. The model was tested by comparing daily simulated and measured water depths for kharif (monsoon) 1999 and rabi (dry) 2000 seasons for outlet 5 l (12.2 ha) of the Tarafeni South Main Canal (North) in the Kangsabati irrigation project, West Bengal, India. The model testing criteria consisted of graphical comparison between simulated and measured water depths; deviation of water depth, Dd (%); Nash–Sutcliff coefficient, R2; and z-test. The model predicted daily water depth reasonably well for both single and multiple field cases and performed better during rabi than kharif season. The model application to the service area (command) of lateral (distributary) 2 l (910.4 ha) revealed that the supply was sufficient to meet about 60 and 23% of the demand, respectively for kharif 1999 and rabi 2000 seasons. Therefore, simulations were done to estimate irrigation demand for an alternative rabi crop (wheat). The comparison between supply and demand revealed that the supply was adequate to meet the irrigation demand of the distributary, and, thus wheat can be taken as an alternate crop during rabi season. Based on the results, it can be said that the ISM is a user-friendly model and can be used for irrigation management at different spatial scales.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nWe previously reported that commercial Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii inoculants failed to outcompete naturalized strains for nodule occupation of clover sown into an alkaline soil [Aust. J. Agric. Res. 53 (2002) 1019]. Two field isolates that dominated nodule occupancy at the field site were labeled with a PnifH-gusA marker. Marked strains were chosen on the basis that they were equally competitive and fixed similar amounts of nitrogen in comparison to their parental strain. The minitransposon insertions were cloned and sequence analysis revealed that neither lesion disrupted the integrity of any known gene. The marked strains were then used to follow nodule occupancy of Trifolium alexandrinum in competition against the commercial inoculant TA1 under a range of experimental conditions. In co-inoculation experiments in sand–vermiculite, TA1 outcompeted each marked field isolate for nodule occupancy. However, using TA1-inoculated seed sown into alkaline soil containing a marked field strain, it was demonstrated that by increasing the cell number of marked rhizobia in the soil and reducing the cell number of the commercial inoculant, the proportion of nodules occupied by TA1 was reduced. These studies indicate that the ability of the field isolates to dominate nodule occupancy in the alkaline field soils was most likely caused by poor commercial inoculant survival providing the advantage for naturalized soil rhizobia to initiate nodulation.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nXylanase A from alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans C-125 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity and anion exchange chromatographies. It exhibited a strong substrate inhibition using xylan as the substrate. Its Ki value increased with an increase in pH. The effect of pH on the enzyme activity was determined using two aryl-xylobiosides as substrates, and it was found that the enzyme had a flat kcat-pH curve in the pH range of 5.8–8.8. This range was different from that obtained with 0.45% xylan as previously reported (Honda, H. et al., Agric. Biol. Chem., 49, 3165–3169, 1985). The substrate inhibition was presumed to cause the difference. It has been clarified that the use of aryl-xylobiosides as substrates yields more accurate kinetic results than that of xylan.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe response of Damask rose to drought and the underlying mechanisms involved are not known. In this study, vegetative, propagated rose plants were grown under control and water-deficit conditions in a greenhouse at Taïf University, south-west of Saudi Arabia. Control plants were irrigated to field capacity (FC), while water-stressed plants were irrigated to either 50% FC (mild stress) or 25% FC (severe stress). After 60 days, leaf, stem and root fresh and dry weights (g plant−1), photosynthetic activity, leaf water potential (Ψw), leaf water content (WC), apoplastic water fraction (AWF), osmotic potential at full turgor (Ψs100) and turgor loss point (Ψs0), cell wall elasticity, osmotic adjustment (OA), and some solutes (K+, Ca2+, Cl−, proline and soluble carbohydrates) were evaluated. Water stress significantly decreased fresh and dry weights of R. damascena and all photosynthetic parameters, apart from leaf temperature, which increased. Severe water stress (25% FC) resulted in more negative Ψs100 and Ψs0 values than the mild water stress and control. The AWF did not significantly change in response to water stress. The leaf bulk modulus of elasticity (ε) increased from 2.5 MPa under well-watered conditions to 2.82 and 3.5 MPa under mild and severe water stress, respectively. R. damascena experienced OA in response to water stress, which was due to the active accumulation of soluble carbohydrates and, to a lesser degree, proline under mild stress, along with tissue dehydration (passive OA) under severe stress.\\nOverall, we identified two important mechanisms of drought tolerance in R. damascena—osmotic and elastic adjustment—but they could not offer resistance to water stress beyond 25% FC.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThis paper presents the performance evaluation of four selected crop water production functions (CWPF).

The objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of short-daylength on growth of forage grasses in low latitude locations. Three grasses (Argentine bahiagrass, Paspalum notatum Flügge; Common guineagrass, Panicum maximum Jacq.; Tifton-85 bermudagrass, Cynodon spp. Pers.) were grown at three locations (south Florida, Puerto Rico, and St. Croix) under extended (15 h) and natural daylength during 2 years. Plots were harvested at 5-week (October–February) and 4-week (March–April) intervals to measure dry matter (DM) yield and nutritive value of the herbage. Daylength effects were found on DM harvested for all grasses in south Florida (P < 0.01). At that location, grasses exposed to increased daylength averaged a 44% increase in DM harvested compared to those grown under natural daylength. Daylength effects were consistent for bahiagrass at the other two locations as well. However, guineagrass and bermudagrass did not respond to extended daylength in Puerto Rico and St. Croix. These results showed that bahiagrass is capable of producing additional forage during the cool season at all locations tested if sensitivity to photoperiod is genetically removed or attenuated.',\n"," \"Abstract\\nAn intercomparison of output from two models estimating spatially distributed surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed imagery is conducted. A major difference between the two models is whether the soil and vegetation components of the scene are treated separately (Two-Source Energy Balance; TSEB approach) or as a lumped composite (one-source approach; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land; SEBAL) in the parameterization of radiative and turbulent exchanges with the overlying air. Comparisons are performed using data from two largescale field experiments covering sub-humid grassland (Southern Great Plains '97) and semi-arid rangeland (Monsoon '90) having very different landscape properties. In general, there was reasonable agreement between flux output from both models versus a handful of flux tower observations. However, spatial intercomparisons of model output over the full modeling domains yielded relatively large discrepancies (on the order of 100 W m− 2) in sensible heat flux (H) that are related to land cover. In particular, bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas yielded the largest discrepancies, with TSEB fluxes being in better agreement with tower observations. Modifications to SEBAL inputs that reduced discrepancies with TSEB and observations for bare soil and shrub classes tended to increase differences for other land cover classes. In particular, improvements to SEBAL inputs of surface roughness for momentum tended to exacerbate errors with respect to observed fluxes. These results suggest that some of the simplifying assumptions in SEBAL may not be strictly applicable over the wide range in conditions present within these landscapes. An analysis of TSEB and SEBAL sensitivity to uncertainties in primary inputs indicated that errors in surface temperature or surface-air temperature differences had the greatest impact on H estimates. Inputs of secondary importance were fractional vegetation cover for TSEB, while for SEBAL, the selection of pixels representing wet and dry moisture end-member conditions significantly influenced flux predictions. The models were also run using input fields derived from both local and remote data sources, to test performance under conditions of varying ancillary data availability. In this case, both models performed similarly under both constraints.\",\n"," 'Abstract\\nCurrent global concerns on attainment of food security and poverty alleviation require new strategies with marked potential for water conservation and yield increase. This informed the design of an affordable continuous-flow drip irrigation system that applies the exact peak crop water requirement continuously throughout the 24 h of a day, and so maintains the crop root zone near field capacity all through the growth season. The design continuous-flow rate was nine drops of water per minute (0.03 l/h) for tomato used as test crop. The system was constructed from inexpensive off-the-shelf components, incorporating the medical infusion set as emitter. The drip system was evaluated in Bauchi State, Nigeria during the 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 irrigation seasons under four continuous-flow rates of 0.03, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07 l/h against a bi-daily application as the control. The recorded yields were 42.9, 42.6, 44.4, and 44.4 t/ha, respectively for the four treatments and 22.3 t/ha from the control. The associated Water Use Efficiencies were 15.5 × 10−2, 10.7 × 10−2, 8.5 × 10−2, and 6.4 × 10−2 t/ha mm in same order for the four discharges, while that of the control was 10.1 × 10−2 t/ha mm. The continuous-flow drip schedule offered water savings of about 42.3 and 15.7% at 0.03 and 0.05 l/h, respectively over short level impoundment furrow irrigation widely used by resource-poor farmers in Nigeria. However, at the higher discharges of 0.06 and 0.07 l/h, the system rather applied 10.1 and 32.2% additional water over furrow irrigation. Results of this study summarily demonstrate promising prospects of the affordable continuous-flow drip irrigation system in delivering high crop yields especially if the crops are grown under appropriate agronomic practices that enable protraction of the growth season. The recommended range of continuous dripping for tomato is 0.03–0.05 l/h.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nIn this study the economic feasibility of using alternative fuels in a mass burn boiler for a chemical plant in northeastern Missouri is analyzed. The key consideration is whether biomass (switchgrass and crop residues) is economically preferred to other available fuels. Research reveals an abundance of alternative fuels for which the plant would receive a tipping fee, including municipal solid waste and used tires. Since the plant would have to pay for biomass, it does not appear in the optimal solution. An economic optimization model shows the marginal cost to the plant of using biomass would increase as more biomass is used, displacing quantities of more valuable (in terms of tipping fees per BTU) waste materials.',\n"," 'Abstract\\nThe effects of aluminium (Al) on the metabolism of organic acids synthesised via nonphotosynthetic carbon fixation in the roots and on malate exudation were investigated in Al-tolerant Shirosanjyaku (SH) and Al-sensitive Chikushikomugi (CK) wheat cultivars labelled with bicarbonate-14C. Aluminum triggered the excretion of 14C into the solution, especially in the SH that excreted 2.5 times more 14C than the CK. The loss of radioactivity (about 10%) into the solution represented a small drain in the 14C reserve found in the roots. In the organic acid fraction within the roots, malate contained the greatest amount of 14C, and this amount decreased rapidly with time in both cultivars. The disappearance of radioactivity in the malate resulted from metabolism and translocation rather than to root efflux. Aluminium decreased the malate concentrations in roots of both cultivars. The Al-sensitive cultivar had higher concentrations of malate regardless of the presence of Al. It was therefore assumed that the decrease of malate concentration in roots under Al stress did not result from the decline in malate synthesis but due to an increase in malate decomposition. This response was interpreted as the result of the Al-induced stress and not as the cause of a differential Al-tolerance between the wheat cultivars. An important component of the differential Al tolerance between SH and CK is the greater ability of the Al-tolerant cultivar to excrete malate from the roots, which is independent of its internal concentration in the roots.',\n"," 'Convolutional neural network (CNN) has great potentials in holographic reconstruction.

We boldly question whether the manually designed inputs are good for DNN training for different tasks and study whether the input to a DNN can be optimally learned end-to-end together with learning the weights of the DNN. In this paper, we propose the paradigm of {\\\\em deep collective learning} which aims to learn the weights of DNNs and the inputs to DNNs simultaneously for given tasks. We note that collective learning has been implicitly but widely used in natural language processing while it has almost never been studied in computer vision. Consequently, we propose the lookup vision networks (Lookup-VNets) as a solution to deep collective learning in computer vision. This is achieved by associating each color in each channel with a vector in lookup tables. As learning inputs in computer vision has almost never been studied in the existing literature, we explore several aspects of this question through varieties of experiments on image classification tasks. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet (ILSVRC2012) have shown several surprising characteristics of Lookup-VNets and have demonstrated the advantages and promise of Lookup-VNets and deep collective learning.',\n"," 'Prior works either considered outage capacity of wireless video transmission systems but did not consider NOMA which is a key technology for 5G ultra-reliable low-latency (URLLC), or concerned the ergodic capacity of NOMA-OFDMA systems but did not consider the outage capacity emphasized in 5G URLLC scenario. In this paper, outage capacity (as well as ergodic capacity) maximization in a 5G URLLC scenario, are considered, using two proposed resource management schemes (i.e. B, C) and finally, proposed deep-learning-based versions of Schemes B and C (i.e. Schemes B’ and C’) to reduce the complexity and the latency for 5G URLLC. The proposed schemes re-allocate subcarrier according to outage capacity- instead of ergodic capacity only-maximization objective and choose the candidate user to gain subcarrier in a new way to improve the outage capacity. The numerical results show the proposed Scheme B and C increase the outage capacity (the percentage of satisfied users) from 79.2% for a prior work (Scheme A) to 85.2% and 92.6%, respectively. Scheme C also increases the ergodic capacity (average PSNR) from 34.7dB for Scheme A to 35.5dB. The deep learning based Schemes B’ and C’ perform slightly poorer than the corresponding non deep learning based Schemes B and C but the execution time/latency of Scheme B’/C’ is less than Schemes B/C.',\n"," 'In suitably initialized wide networks, small learning rates transform deep neural networks (DNNs) into neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, whose training dynamics is well-approximated by a linear weight expansion of the network at initialization. Standard training, however, diverges from its linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training. During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance matches that of full network training in 15% to 45% of training time. Overall, our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the first few epochs, that together poses challenges and opportunities for the development of more accurate theories of deep learning.',\n"," 'Cytometry technologies are essential tools for immunology research, providing high-throughput measurements of the immune cells at the single-cell level. Existing approaches in interpreting and using cytometry measurements include manual or automated gating to identify cell subsets from the cytometry data, providing highly intuitive results but may lead to significant information loss, in that additional details in measured or correlated cell signals might be missed. In this study, we propose and test a deep convolutional neural network for analyzing cytometry data in an end-to-end fashion, allowing a direct association between raw cytometry data and the clinical outcome of interest. Using nine large cytometry by time-of-flight mass spectrometry or mass cytometry (CyTOF) studies from the open-access ImmPort database, we demonstrated that the deep convolutional neural network model can accurately diagnose the latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) in healthy individuals, even when using highly heterogeneous data from different studies. In addition, we developed a permutation-based method for interpreting the deep convolutional neural network model. We were able to identify a CD27- CD94+ CD8+ T cell population significantly associated with latent CMV infection, confirming the findings in previous studies. Finally, we provide a tutorial for creating, training, and interpreting the tailored deep learning model for cytometry data using Keras and TensorFlow (https://github.com/hzc363/DeepLearningCyTOF).',\n"," 'The relationship between face and disease has been discussed from thousands years ago, which leads to the occurrence of facial diagnosis. The objective here is to explore the possibility of identifying diseases from uncontrolled 2D face images by deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose using deep transfer learning from face recognition to perform the computer-aided facial diagnosis on various diseases. In the experiments, we perform the computer-aided facial diagnosis on single (beta-thalassemia) and multiple diseases (beta-thalassemia, hyperthyroidism, Down syndrome, and leprosy) with a relatively small dataset. The overall top-1 accuracy by deep transfer learning from face recognition can reach over 90% which outperforms the performance of both traditional machine learning methods and clinicians in the experiments. In practical, collecting disease-specific face images is complex, expensive and time consuming, and imposes ethical limitations due to personal data treatment. Therefore, the datasets of facial diagnosis related researches are private and generally small comparing with the ones of other machine learning application areas. The success of deep transfer learning applications in the facial diagnosis with a small dataset could provide a low-cost and noninvasive way for disease screening and detection.',\n"," 'Data augmentation, which is the process for creating alternative copies of each sample in a small training data set, is important for extracting deep-learning features for medical image classification problems. However, data augmentation has not been well explored and existing methods are heuristic. In this paper, a geostatistical simulation of images is introduced as a data augmentation approach for extracting deep-learning features from medical images that are characterized with texture. The stochastic simulation procedure is to generate realizations of an image by modeling its spatial variability through the generation of multiple equiprobable stochastic realizations. The approach employed for the geostatistical simulation is based on the concepts of regionalized variables and kriging formulation to create multiple textural variations of medical images. Experimental results on classifying two medical-image data sets show that the use of geostatistical simulation for extracting deep-learning features with several popular pre-trained deep-learning models (AlexNet, ResNet-50, and GoogLeNet/Inception) provided better accuracy rates and more balanced results in terms of sensitivity and specificity than either with or without the implementation of conventional data augmentation. The proposed approach can be applied to other pre-trained networks as well as those without data pre-training for effective deep-feature extraction from medical images. The proposed application of the theory of geostatistics for medical image data augmentation in deep learning is original. The novelty of this approach can also be applied to many other types of data that are inherently textural. Geostatistical simulation opens a new door to the development of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence in feature extraction of medical images.',\n"," 'We propose Parametric UMAP, a parametric variation of the UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) algorithm. UMAP is a non-parametric graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithm using applied Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology to find low-dimensional embeddings of structured data. The UMAP algorithm consists of two steps: (1) Compute a graphical representation of a dataset (fuzzy simplicial complex), and (2) Through stochastic gradient descent, optimize a low-dimensional embedding of the graph. Here, we replace the second step of UMAP with a deep neural network that learns a parametric relationship between data and embedding. We demonstrate that our method performs similarly to its non-parametric counterpart while conferring the benefit of a learned parametric mapping (e.g. fast online embeddings for new data). We then show that UMAP loss can be extended to arbitrary deep learning applications, for example constraining the latent distribution of autoencoders, and improving classifier accuracy for semi-supervised learning by capturing structure in unlabeled data.

Machine Learning as a Service, (MLaaS) which leverages deep learning techniques for predictive analytics to enhance decision-making, has become a hot commodity. However, the adoption of MLaaS introduces data privacy challenges for data owners and security challenges for deep learning model owners. Data owners are concerned about the safety and privacy of their data on MLaaS platforms, while MLaaS platform owners worry that their models could be stolen by adversaries who pose as clients. Consequently, Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) arises as a possible solution to this problem. Recently, several papers about PPDL for MLaaS have been published. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous paper has summarized the existing literature on PPDL and its specific applicability to the MLaaS environment. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of privacy-preserving techniques, starting from classical privacy-preserving techniques to well-known deep learning techniques. Additionally, we present a detailed description of PPDL and address the issue of using PPDL for MLaaS. Furthermore, we undertake detailed comparisons between state-of-the-art PPDL methods. Subsequently, we classify an adversarial model on PPDL by highlighting possible PPDL attacks and their potential solutions. Ultimately, our paper serves as a single point of reference for detailed knowledge on PPDL and its applicability to MLaaS environments for both new and experienced researchers.',\n"," 'The impressive performance exhibited by modern machine learning models hinges on the ability to train such models on a very large amounts of labeled data. However, since access to large volumes of labeled data is often limited or expensive, it is desirable to alleviate this bottleneck by carefully curating the training set. Optimal experimental design is a well-established paradigm for selecting data point to be labeled so to maximally inform the learning process. Unfortunately, classical theory on optimal experimental design focuses on selecting examples in order to learn underparameterized (and thus, non-interpolative) models, while modern machine learning models such as deep neural networks are overparameterized, and oftentimes are trained to be interpolative. As such, classical experimental design methods are not applicable in many modern learning setups. Indeed, the predictive performance of underparameterized models tends to be variance dominated, so classical experimental design focuses on variance reduction, while the predictive performance of overparameterized models can also be, as is shown in this paper, bias dominated or of mixed nature. In this paper we propose a design strategy that is well suited for overparameterized regression and interpolation, and we demonstrate the applicability of our method in the context of deep learning by proposing a new algorithm for single-shot deep active learning.',\n"," \"The nature of stock market movement has always been ambiguous for investors because of various influential factors. This study aims to significantly reduce the risk of trend prediction with machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Four stock market groups, namely diversified financials, petroleum, non-metallic minerals and basic metals from Tehran stock exchange, are chosen for experimental evaluations. This study compares nine machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) and two powerful deep learning methods (Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM). Ten technical indicators from ten years of historical data are our input values, and two ways are supposed for employing them. Firstly, calculating the indicators by stock trading values as continuous data, and secondly converting indicators to binary data before using. Each prediction model is evaluated by three metrics based on the input ways. The evaluation results indicate that for the continuous data, RNN and LSTM outperform other prediction models with a considerable difference. Also, results show that in the binary data evaluation, those deep learning methods are the best; however, the difference becomes less because of the noticeable improvement of models' performance in the second way.\",\n"," 'Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are being increasingly deployed for commercial, civilian, and military applications. The current UAS state-of-the-art still depends on a remote human controller with robust wireless links to perform several of these applications. The lack of autonomy restricts the domains of application and tasks for which a UAS can be deployed. Enabling autonomy and intelligence to the UAS will help overcome this hurdle and expand its use improving safety and efficiency. The exponential increase in computing resources and the availability of large amount of data in this digital era has led to the resurgence of machine learning from its last winter. Therefore, in this chapter, we discuss how some of the advances in machine learning, specifically deep learning and reinforcement learning can be leveraged to develop next-generation autonomous UAS. We first begin motivating this chapter by discussing the application, challenges, and opportunities of the current UAS in the introductory section. We then provide an overview of some of the key deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques discussed throughout this chapter. A key area of focus that will be essential to enable autonomy to UAS is computer vision. Accordingly, we discuss how deep learning approaches have been used to accomplish some of the basic tasks that contribute to providing UAS autonomy. Then we discuss how reinforcement learning is explored for using this information to provide autonomous control and navigation for UAS. Next, we provide the reader with directions to choose appropriate simulation suites and hardware platforms that will help to rapidly prototype novel machine learning based solutions for UAS. We additionally discuss the open problems and challenges pertaining to each aspect of developing autonomous UAS solutions to shine light on potential research areas.',\n"," \"Chronic heart failure (CHF) affects over 26 million of people worldwide, and its incidence is increasing by 2% annually. Despite the significant burden that CHF poses and despite the ubiquity of sensors in our lives, methods for automatically detecting CHF are surprisingly scarce, even in the research community. We present a method for CHF detection based on heart sounds. The method combines classic Machine-Learning (ML) and end-to-end Deep Learning (DL). The classic ML learns from expert features, and the DL learns from a spectro-temporal representation of the signal. The method was evaluated on recordings from 947 subjects from six publicly available datasets and one CHF dataset that was collected for this study. Using the same evaluation method as a recent PhysoNet challenge, the proposed method achieved a score of 89.3, which is 9.1 higher than the challenge's baseline method. The method's aggregated accuracy is 92.9% (error of 7.1%); while the experimental results are not directly comparable, this error rate is relatively close to the percentage of recordings labeled as “unknown” by experts (9.7%). Finally, we identified 15 expert features that are useful for building ML models to differentiate between CHF phases (i.e., in the decompensated phase during hospitalization and in the recompensated phase) with an accuracy of 93.2%. The proposed method shows promising results both for the distinction of recordings between healthy subjects and patients and for the detection of different CHF phases. This may lead to the easier identification of new CHF patients and the development of home-based CHF monitors for avoiding hospitalizations.\",\n"," 'Current deep learning research is dominated by benchmark evaluation. A method is regarded as favorable if it empirically performs well on the dedicated test set. This mentality is seamlessly reflected in the resurfacing area of continual learning, where consecutively arriving sets of benchmark data are investigated. The core challenge is framed as protecting previously acquired representations from being catastrophically forgotten due to the iterative parameter updates. However, comparison of individual methods is nevertheless treated in isolation from real world application and typically judged by monitoring accumulated test set performance. The closed world assumption remains predominant. It is assumed that during deployment a model is guaranteed to encounter data that stems from the same distribution as used for training. This poses a massive challenge as neural networks are well known to provide overconfident false predictions on unknown instances and break down in the face of corrupted data. In this work we argue that notable lessons from open set recognition, the identification of statistically deviating data outside of the observed dataset, and the adjacent field of active learning, where data is incrementally queried such that the expected performance gain is maximized, are frequently overlooked in the deep learning era. Based on these forgotten lessons, we propose a consolidated view to bridge continual learning, active learning and open set recognition in deep neural networks. Our results show that this not only benefits each individual paradigm, but highlights the natural synergies in a common framework. We empirically demonstrate improvements when alleviating catastrophic forgetting, querying data in active learning, selecting task orders, while exhibiting robust open world application where previously proposed methods fail.',\n"," 'Channel state information (CSI)-based human activity recognition plays an essential role in various application domains, such as security, healthcare, and Internet of Things. Most existing CSI-based activity recognition approaches rely on manually designed features that are classified using traditional classification methods. Furthermore, the use of deep learning methods for CSI-based activity recognition is still at its infancy with most of the existing approaches focus on recognizing single-human activities. The current study explores the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to recognize human-to-human interactions (HHIs) using CSI signals. Particularly, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework that comprises three phases, which are the input, feature extraction, and recognition phases. The input phase converts the raw CSI signals into CSI images that comprise time, frequency, and spatial information. In the feature extraction phase, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to automatically extract deep features from the CSI images. Finally, the extracted features are fed to the recognition phase to identify the class of the HHI associated with each CSI image. The performance of our proposed framework is assessed using a publicly available CSI dataset that was acquired from 40 different pairs of subjects while performing 13 HHIs. Our proposed framework achieved an average recognition accuracy of 86.3% across all HHIs. Moreover, the experiments indicate that our proposed framework enabled significant improvements over the results achieved using three state-of-the-art pre-trained CNNs as well as the results obtained using four different conventional classifiers that employs traditional handcrafted features.',\n"," \"This paper contributes to the study of PUFs vulnerability against modeling attacks by evaluating the security of XOR BR PUFs, XOR TBR PUFs, and obfuscated architectures of XOR BR PUF using a simplified mathematical model and deep learning (DL) techniques. Obtained results show that DL modeling attacks could easily break the security of 4-input XOR BR PUFs and 4-input XOR TBR PUFs with modeling accuracy \\\\sim 99%. Similar attacks were executed using single-layer neural networks (NN) and support vector machines (SVM) with polynomial kernel and the obtained results showed that single NNs failed to break the PUF security. Furthermore, SVM results confirmed the same modeling accuracy reported in previous research (\\\\sim 50%). For the first time, this research empirically shows that DL networks can be used as powerful modeling techniques against these complex PUF architectures for which previous conventional machine learning techniques had failed. Furthermore, a detailed scalability analysis is conducted on the DL networks with respect to PUFs' stage size and complexity. The analysis shows that the number of layers and hidden neurons inside every layer has a linear relationship with PUFs' stage size, which agrees with the theoretical findings in deep learning. Consequently, A new obfuscated architecture is introduced as a first step to counter DL modeling attacks and it showed significant resistance against such attacks (16% - 40% less accuracy). This research provides an important step towards prioritizing the efforts to introduce new PUF architectures that are more secure and invulnerable to modeling attacks. Moreover, it triggers future discussions on the removal of influential bits and the level of obfuscation needed to confirm that a specific PUF architecture is resistant against powerful DL modeling attacks.\",\n"," \"There are many techniques using sensors and wearable devices for detecting and monitoring patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). A recent development is the utilization of human interaction with computer keyboards for analyzing and identifying motor signs in the early stages of the disease. Current designs for classification of time series of computer-key hold durations recorded from healthy control and PD subjects require the time series of length to be considerably long. With an attempt to avoid discomfort to participants in performing long physical tasks for data recording, this paper introduces the use of fuzzy recurrence plots of very short time series as input data for the machine training and classification with long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Being an original approach that is able to both significantly increase the feature dimensions and provides the property of deterministic dynamical systems of very short time series for information processing carried out by an LSTM layer architecture, fuzzy recurrence plots provide promising results and outperform the direct input of the time series for the classification of healthy control and early PD subjects.\",\n"," 'Duplicate bug report detection is a process of finding a duplicate bug report in the bug tracking system. This process is essential to avoid unnecessary work and rediscovery. In typical bug tracking systems, more than thousands of duplicate bug reports are reported every day. In turn, human cost, effort and time are increased. This makes it an important problem in the software management process. The solution is to automate the duplicate bug report detection system for reducing the manual effort, thus the productivity of triager’s and developer’s is increased. It also speeds up the process of software management as a result software maintenance cost is also reduced. However, existing systems are not quite accurate yet, in spite of these systems used various machine learning approaches.

The proposed system has three modules i.e. Preprocessing, Deep Learning Model and Duplicate Bug report Detection and Classification. Further, the proposed model used Convolutional Neural Network based deep learning model to extract relevant feature. These relevant features are used to determine the similar features of bug reports. Hence, the bug reports similarity is computers through these similar features. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on six publicly available datasets using six performance metrics. It is noticed that the proposed system outperforms the existing systems by achieving an accuracy rate in the range of 85% to 99 % and recall@k rate in between 79%–94%. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed system is also measured on the cross training datasets of same and different domain.

Hardware performance counter values are correlated with properties of applications that impact performance and power on the underlying system. We use the datasets collected for two parallel cancer deep learning CANDLE benchmarks, NT3 (weak scaling) and P1B2 (strong scaling), to build performance and power models based on hardware performance counters using single-object and multiple-objects ensemble learning to identify the most important counters for improvement.

Routine delineation of these muscles during planning may improve dose tracking and facilitate dose reduction resulting in decreased radiation-related trismus. This study aimed to compare a deep learning model with a commercial atlas-based model for fast auto-segmentation of the masticatory muscles on head and neck computed tomography (CT) images. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Paired masseter (M), temporalis (T), medial and lateral pterygoid (MP, LP) muscles were manually segmented on 56 CT images. CT images were randomly divided into training (n = 27) and validation (n = 29) cohorts. Two methods were used for automatic delineation of masticatory muscles (MMs): Deep learning auto-segmentation (DLAS) and atlas-based auto-segmentation (ABAS). The automatic algorithms were evaluated using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), recall, precision, Hausdorff distance (HD), HD95, and mean surface distance (MSD). A consolidated score was calculated by normalizing the metrics against interobserver variability and averaging over all patients. Differences in dose (∆Dose) to MMs for DLAS and ABAS segmentations were assessed. A paired t-test was used to compare the geometric and dosimetric difference between DLAS and ABAS methods. RESULTS:DLAS outperformed ABAS in delineating all MMs (p 0.05). DLAS based contours had dose endpoints more closely matched with that of the manually segmented when compared with ABAS. CONCLUSIONS:DLAS auto-segmentation of masticatory muscles for the head and neck radiotherapy had improved segmentation accuracy compared with ABAS with no qualitative difference in dosimetric endpoints compared to manually segmented contours.',\n"," 'The accurate forecast of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) key features can comprehend and predict the plant behavior to support process design and controls, improve system reliability, reduce operational costs, and endorse optimization of overall performances. Deep learning technologies as proven data-driven soft-sensors should be developed for WWTP applications to tackle the process of non-linearity and the dynamic nature of environmental data. This study adopts deep learning-based models as soft-sensors to forecast WWTP key features, such as influent flow, influent temperature, influent biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), effluent chloride, effluent BOD, and power consumption. We constructed six deep learning models derived from long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), namely traditional LSTM and GRU, the exponentially smoothed LSTM, and the adaptive version of LSTM and smoothed LSTM. The employment of a smoothed LSTM technique is expected to reduce the outlier effect and to improve forecasting accuracy. Meanwhile, the usage of adaptive deep models will enhance the capabilities of the LSTM to quickly and accurately follow the trend of future data. We compared the performance of these models with Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) and the seasonal decomposition using local regression. The historical records from a coastal municipal WWTP in Saudi Arabia are used to verify the investigated models’ effectiveness. The proposed models provide promising forecasting results but require no assumptions on the data distributions. In terms of efficiency, GRU based models converge faster than LSTM based models. In terms of accuracy, the LSTM soft-sensor shows overall the optimal result for all key features followed by the exponentially-smoothed GRU and LSTM. By contrast, the adaptive models achieved the lowest forecasting performance compared to the other models. These findings will benefit practitioners to achieve data-driven WWTP management.',\n"," 'Prediction of stock prices has been an important area of research for a long time. While supporters of the efficient market hypothesis believe that it is impossible to predict stock prices accurately, there are formal propositions demonstrating that accurate modeling and designing of appropriate variables may lead to models using which stock prices and stock price movement patterns can be very accurately predicted. In this work, we propose an approach of hybrid modeling for stock price prediction building different machine learning and deep learning-based models.

However, cumbersome algorithms that require the reference maternal ECG as well as heavy feature crafting makes out-of-clinics fECG monitoring in daily life not yet feasible. To address these challenges, we proposed a pure end-to-end deep learning model to detect fetal QRS complexes (i.e., the main spikes observed on a fetal ECG waveform). Additionally, the model has the residual network (ResNet) architecture that adopts the novel 1-D octave convolution (OctConv) for learning multiple temporal frequency features, which in turn reduce memory and computational cost. Importantly, the model is capable of highlighting the contribution of regions that are more prominent for the detection. To evaluate our approach, data from the PhysioNet 2013 Challenge with labeled QRS complex annotations were used in the original form, and the data were then modified with Gaussian and motion noise, mimicking real-world scenarios. The model can achieve a F1 score of 91.1% while being able to save more than 50% computing cost with less than 2% performance degradation, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.',\n"," 'Social Media has become an integral part of our daily life. Not only it enables collaboration and flow of information but has also become an imperative tool for businesses and governments around the world. All this makes a compelling case for everyone to be on some sort of online social media platform. However, this virtuousness is overshadowed by some of its shortcomings. The manifestation of antisocial behaviour online is a growing concern that hinders participation and cultivates numerous social problems. Antisocial behaviour exists in its various forms such as aggression, disregard for safety, lack of remorse, unlawful behaviour, etc. The paper introduces a deep learning-based approach to detect and classify online antisocial behaviour (ASB). The automatic content classification addresses the issue of scalability, which is imperative when dealing with online platforms. A benchmark dataset was created with multi-class annotation under the supervision of a domain expert. Extensive experiments were conducted with multiple deep learning algorithms and their superior results were validated against the results from the traditional machine learning algorithms. Visually enhanced interpretation of the classification process is presented for model and error analyses. Accuracy of up to 99% in class identification was achieved on the ground truth dataset for empirical validation. The study is an evidence of how the cutting-edge deep learning technology can be utilized to solve a real-world problem of curtailing antisocial behaviour, which is a public health threat and a social problem.',\n"," 'We have proposed to develop a global hybrid deep learning framework to predict the daily prices in the stock market.

More especially, during special holidays, such as the Lunar New Year and the Chuseok (Mid-autumn day), the demand for delivery service increases sharply in South Korea. It makes a challenge to forecast demand to provide a normal delivery schedule for the Korean mail center. To address this problem, we propose a novel deep learning model equipped with selection and update layers (MLP-SUL) to achieve high predictive performance. The proposed model consists of three main parts: the first part of the model learns to generate context-dependent weights to decide which input feed to the next layer; the second part updates the weighted input to prepare encoded input, and the third part is a prediction layer that consists of a linear layer. A linear layer takes encoded input for forecasting demand. We also introduce a special data preprocessing step for our task that requires long-term forecasting. The experimental results show that our proposed deep learning model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Korean mail center datasets.',\n"," \"Deep learning classifiers are assisting humans in making decisions and hence the user's trust in these models is of paramount importance. Trust is often a function of constant behavior. From an AI model perspective it means given the same input the user would expect the same output, especially for correct outputs, or in other words consistently correct outputs. This paper studies a model behavior in the context of periodic retraining of deployed models where the outputs from successive generations of the models might not agree on the correct labels assigned to the same input. We formally define consistency and correct-consistency of a learning model. We prove that consistency and correct-consistency of an ensemble learner is not less than the average consistency and correct-consistency of individual learners and correct-consistency can be improved with a probability by combining learners with accuracy not less than the average accuracy of ensemble component learners. To validate the theory using three datasets and two state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers we also propose an efficient dynamic snapshot ensemble method and demonstrate its value.\",\n"," 'Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are a type of deep learning architecture introduced to achieve the correct classification of breast cancer. This paper has a two-fold purpose. The first aim is to investigate the various deep learning models in classifying breast cancer histopathology images. This study identified the most accurate models in terms of the binary, four, and eight classifications of breast cancer histopathology image databases. The different accuracy scores obtained for the deep learning models on the same database showed that other factors such as pre-processing, data augmentation, and transfer learning methods can impact the ability of the models to achieve higher accuracy. The second purpose of our manuscript is to investigate the latest models that have no or limited examination done in previous studies. The models like ResNeXt, Dual Path Net, SENet, and NASNet had been identified with the most cutting-edge results for the ImageNet database. These models were examined for the binary, and eight classifications on BreakHis, a breast cancer histopathology image database. Furthermore, the BACH database was used to investigate these models for four classifications. Then, these models were compared with the previous studies to find and propose the most state-of-the-art models for each classification. Since the Inception-ResNet-V2 architecture achieved the best results for binary and eight classifications, we have examined this model in our study as well to provide a better comparison result. In short, this paper provides an extensive evaluation and discussion about the experimental settings for each study that had been conducted on the breast cancer histopathology images.',\n"," 'Deep learning techniques are commonly used to process large amounts of data, and good results are obtained in many applications. Those methods, however, can lead to long training times. An alternative to simultaneously tune all parameters of a large network is to stack smaller modules, improving the model efficiency. However, methods such as Deep Stacked Network (DSN) have some problems that increase its training time and memory usage. To deal with these problems, Fast DSN (FDSN) was proposed, where the modules are trained using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) variant. Nonetheless, to speed-up the FDSN training, the ELM random feature mapping is shared among the modules, which can impact the network performance if the weights are not properly chosen. In this paper, we focus on the weight initialization of FDSN in order to improve its performance. We also propose FKDSN, a kernel-based variant of FDSN, besides discussing the theoretical complexity of the methods. We evaluate three different initialization approaches on ELM-trained neural networks over 50 public real-world regression datasets. Our experiments show that FDSN when combined with a more complex initialization method achieves similar results to ELM algorithms applied to large SLFNs, besides having a shorter training time and memory usage, implying that it can be suitable to be used on systems with restrict resources, such as Internet of Things devices. FKDSN also obtained similar results and training time to the large SLFNs, requiring less memory.

In that aim, they need to adapt the way they design to respond to farm diversity, and to deal with knowledge gaps and uncertainty. This study sets out to improve understanding of design reasoning in agronomy. Our assumption is that tracking different reasoning patterns to their roots will shed light on conditions of their development and provide a better understanding of how new agronomic approaches emerge. To do so, we coupled a genealogical approach with a characterization of design regimes. Our work is based on a body of published work by French agronomists from the 18th century to the 21th, selected for their design-oriented nature. Applying an analytical framework built on design theory, we characterized five archetypical design regimes that emerged in connection with developments in the organization of agricultural R&D and shifts in agronomy's epistemological trends. For each one, we described an archetype of agronomists' reasoning, as well as the organizational model and performance logics that conditioned its development. Our results show first that the chains of cognitive operations that make up the agronomists' reasoning are different in each regime, as for example the way agronomists define the design issue and how they explore innovative concepts. Second, our analysis shows that each reasoning pattern generates a specific kind of output which offer farmers different action capabilities: for example, action rules that farmers simply apply, or design support tools to help farmers design techniques themselves. Comparing the design regimes, we identified four factors that influenced agronomists' design explorations: (i) their representations of agriculture, (ii) the scientific tools they use, (iii) their interactions with farmers, and (iv) their links with other scientific disciplines. We finally discuss the contribution of design science to better understanding of the diversity of design reasoning patterns in agronomy and we bring to light some avenues for future research with a view to enriching agronomists' “design toolbox” and supporting co-design in agriculture. We expect this work to offer a useful perspective to agronomists starting a design oriented work to support the evolution of practices on farm.\",\n"," 'Highlights •Valeriana jatamansi is an important crop for phytopharmaceutical industries.•The demand of this herb is also increasing in essential oil-based industries.•However, this species is now at the verge of extinction due to over-exploitation.•The anatomy of this plant was studied through scanning electron microscope.•Crop-ecology and agrotechnology have been elucidated for commercial cultivation.',\n"," 'Increasingly, Agricultural Innovation Systems, AIS, have been recognized as fundamentals pathways for agricultural science impact.

Due to acculturation and urbanization coupled with climate change, emerging pests and the introduction of new crops, the extensive indigenous knowledge associated with this crop is in danger of being lost, imperilling the future food security and prosperity of millions of Ethiopians. Here, we synthesize the current state of enset ethnobotanical research, identifying key gaps and challenges, and provide a framework for further enset research to safeguard this important, but neglected, tropical crop. Summary Enset (Ensete ventricosum (Welw.) Cheesman) is the major starch staple of the Ethiopian Highlands, where its unique attributes enhance the food security of approximately 20 million people and have earned it the title “The Tree Against Hunger”. Yet enset‐based agriculture is virtually unknown outside of its narrow zone of cultivation, despite growing wild across much of East and Southern Africa. Here, we review historical production data to show that the area of land under enset production in Ethiopia has reportedly increased 46% in two decades, whilst yield increased 12‐fold over the same period, making enset the second most produced crop species in Ethiopia—though we critically evaluate potential issues with these data. Furthermore, we address a major challenge in the development and wider cultivation of enset, by reviewing and synthesizing the complex and fragmented agronomic and ethnobotanic knowledge associated with this species; including farming systems, processing methods, products, medicinal uses and cultural importance. Finally, we provide a framework to improve the quality, consistency and comparability of data collected across culturally diverse enset‐based agricultural systems to enhanced sustainable use of this neglected starch staple. In conclusion, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for enset cultivation beyond its restricted distribution, and the regional food security potential it could afford smallholders elsewhere in Southern and East Africa.',\n"," 'The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of irrigation delivery services and agricultural extension services on crop choice in southern Tajikistan. This analysis is motivated by the government’s recent efforts to address the country’s severe malnutrition problem by supporting changes in irrigation service delivery and agronomy to increase diversity in agricultural production and consumption, in an environment where the cultivation of cotton had, until recently, been mandatory. Water management in Tajikistan has largely been transferred to the community through the creation of water users’ associations (WUAs), which were established between 2011 and 2013. While all WUAs received training to improve irrigation delivery services, some also received training in cultivating alternative crops and improving cultivation practices through agricultural extension services. Through specific empirical analysis conducted on a primary panel dataset of 1855 farms in southern Tajikistan, we identify the extent to which improvements in irrigation services, and agronomy training through extension services affect decisions pertaining to cultivated areas of cotton and wheat (the traditional crops) and the cultivated area and number of (newer) high-value crops. We also examine the effect of water delivery and agricultural extension services on crop diversity and cropping intensity (how often land is used in a calendar year). We find that improvements in irrigation delivery services affect cultivated areas of cotton and wheat. Cultivation of high value crops is significantly influenced by agricultural extension services. While cropping intensity depends on water delivery services, crop diversity depends on extension services. From a policy perspective, these results highlight the importance of agricultural programs for stimulating agricultural value added in landscapes historically characterized by limited crop choice and a collapse of the agricultural sector.',\n"," \"To appraise the major research outputs of agronomic crops and cropping systems and to direct the future research priorities of Agronomy Department of post-graduate (PG) program of Institute of Agriculture and Animal Sciences (IAAS), a rigorous review was accomplished on about two decadal (2000-2018) student’s thesis research works. The review revealed that the agronomic researches at IAAS from 2000 to 2012 were concentrated mostly in on-station farm of Rampur, Chitwan and found their focus on 11 food grain crops with five major themes viz. varietal evaluation, crop management, soil nutrient and weeds management, and crop simulation modeling. With the shifting of IAAS PG program from Rampur to Kirtipur in 2013, the major agronomic researches were found to be concentrated in on-farm stations due to transitional movement of IAAS to Agriculture and Forestry University, Nepal. A total of 115 agronomic studies were conducted on various crops, of which 92 were on cereals, 8 on legumes, oilseed and minor cereals including potato. There were records of 10 studies on rice-wheat and 3 studies on maize-based systems. The huge gaps between the potential and farmers' field yield and between the potential and research station yields for rice, maize and wheat crops suggested a great scope to raise yields of cereals by improved agronomical researches on varieties evaluation, crop and nutrient management and weed management. Simulation modeling study predicted that the varieties of rice and maize adopted at present could sustain the yields only for recent few years and needed for introduction of new climate resilient varieties, then after. Innovative and new researches on eco-region suited on-farm trails with variety identification, improved crop husbandry and soil nutrient management, improved weed and water management and on agro-meteorology, conservation agriculture, climate change adaptation and crop simulation modeling are advised as future research frontiers to uplift the productivity and reduce yield gaps of major food crops and to strengthen the academics of post-graduate research in near future.\",\n"," 'The author would like to make the following correction to the published paper [...]',\n"," 'The authors retract their recent published article [...]',\n"," 'Mobile smartphones, open-source set tools, and mobile applications have provided vast opportunities for timely, accurate, and seamless data collection, aggregation, storage, and analysis of agricultural data in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In this paper, we advanced and demonstrated the practical use and application of a mobile smartphone-based tool, i.e., the Open Data Kit (ODK), to assemble and keep track of real-time maize (Zea mays L.) phenological data in three SSA countries. Farmers, extension agents, researchers, and other stakeholders were enlisted to participate in an initiative to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphone-based apps and open-source servers for rapid data collection and management. A pre-installed maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants (n = 75) for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in 2015–2017. The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date, date of emergence, date of first flowering, anthesis, grain filling, and maturity. Results showed that in Ethiopia, early maturing varieties took 105 days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes, whereas late-maturing varieties took up to 190 days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas. In Tanzania, a similar trend was observed, whereas in Nigeria, most existing varieties took an average of 100 days to complete their developmental stages. Furthermore, the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence, emergence to flowering, flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature. The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety, which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development. The data aggregation approach using the ODK and on-farm personnel improved efficiency and convenience in data collection and visualization.

While agriculture is facing increasing challenges to meet current societal expectations, several studies in agronomy have focused on the design processes that allow farmers to change their agricultural systems. Most of these processes have been dedicated to designing target agricultural systems but, more recently, several studies have acknowledged that agro-ecological practices replace farmers as the actual designers of their own production systems. In this context, how can agronomists support such design processes? How does a better understanding of these processes challenge the inputs that research agronomists can propose, to support them? We contribute to answering these questions by reviewing a case study of a design process supported and analyzed by research agronomists over several years. This case illustrates that the design of agricultural systems is a process that exceeds invention: the implementation of the initial design solutions produces information that should be used to review those same solutions, in order to reach the design goal. The case study shows that the design process depends on a tension between the exploration of an ambitious desirable future and its actual implementation. To foster dialogue between “desirable” and “actual”, we show how the researchers involved in this case provided a range of inputs that supported typical design activities (grounding, fostering design reasoning, reinterpreting this reasoning, and design strategy throughout the process), thus opening new avenues of research in agronomy.',\n"," 'In order to make more efficient plant breeding and gain in competitiveness, the sector of oil-protein crops decided to intensify agronomic research on sunflower crop.

By 2030, a 20% increase in rice yield will be required to meet the growing demand for food that will result from population growth. The success of China’s super hybrid rice was expected to provide an opportunity to cope with the increased demand for rice. However, in China the planting area of super hybrid rice is less than 8% of the national total rice planting area and the planting area of hybrid rice has continued to decline since 1996. The decreased planting area of hybrid rice is related to the shift in rice establishment methods from manual transplanting to direct seeding and mechanical transplanting. These shifts can result in increased seeding rates and reduced morphological advantages of heterosis (e.g. reduced panicle size), both of which can influence cultivar choice by rice farmers, who will tend to favor cheaper inbred cultivars. The shifts in rice establishment methods can also eliminate or reduce the seedling nursey period and subsequently shorten the growth duration and negatively affect the yield. We anticipate that the above problems will be resolved by integrating mechanization (e.g. designing high-precision seed sowing machines) with agronomy (e.g. improving management practices for increasing seed vigor) and breeding (e.g. developing high-yielding cultivars with short growth durations). This strategy also has implications for production of other crops in intensive farming systems in China and for other developing countries with rice-based intensive cropping systems.',\n"," 'The authors wish to correct the following erratum in this paper [...]',\n"," 'В статье на основе современной историографии и широкого круга источников рассмотрены история создания, динамика развития, основные направления и результаты деятельности правительственной агрономической службы в Сибири.

The point at which early seeding results in a decrease in grain yield has not been clearly identified. Changes in climatic conditions have increased frost-free periods and increased temperatures during grain filling, which can either be taken advantage of or avoided by seeding earlier. Field trials were conducted in western Canada from 2015 to 2018 to evaluate an ultra-early wheat planting system based on soil temperature triggers as opposed to calendar dates. Planting began when soil temperatures at 5 cm depth reached 0°C and continued at 2°C intervals until 10°C, regardless of calendar date. Conventional commercial spring wheat genetics and newly identified cold tolerant spring wheat lines were evaluated to determine if ultra-early wheat seeding systems required further development of specialized varieties to maintain system stability. Ultra-early seeding resulted in no detrimental effect on grain yield. Grain yield increased at sites south of 51° latitude N, and was unaffected by ultra-early seeding at sites north of 51° latitude N. Grain protein content, kernel weight, and bulk density were not affected by ultra-early seeding. Optimal seeding time was identified between 2 and 6°C soil temperatures. A greater reduction in grain yield was observed from delaying planting until soils reached 10°C than from seeding into 0°C soils; this was despite extreme environmental conditions after initial seeding, including air temperatures as low as −10.2°C, and as many as 37 nights with air temperatures below 0°C. Wheat emergence ranged from 55 to 70%, and heads m−2 decreased with delayed seeding while heads plant−1 did not change. Cold tolerant wheat lines did not increase stability of the ultra-early wheat seeding system relative to the conventional spring wheat check, and are therefore not required for growers to adopt ultra-early seeding. The results of this study indicate that growers in western Canada can successfully begin seeding wheat earlier, with few changes to their current management practices, and endure less risk than delaying seeding until soil temperatures reach 10°C or greater.',\n"," 'The University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca celebrates, this year, 2019, a century and a half since its establishment, in 1869.

During 2014–2017, the influence of some main agronomy factors on the size of the resultant agronomic effect from their application to contemporary common winter wheat cultivars was investigated. The study was carried out in the experimental field (Haplic Chernozems soil type) of Dobrudzha Agricultural 2 Institute – General Toshevo. The trial was designed by the split plot method, in four replications, on harvest area of 12m . Cultivars Sadovo 1, Pryaspa, Kami, Kalina, Kiara, Kossara and Katarjina were grown after winter oilseed rape, spring pea, sunflower and grain maize at four levels of nutrition regime. The nutrition regime was differentiated depending on the previous crop. After spring pea, 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha were used, and after the rest of the previous crops – 60, 120 and 180 kg N/ha. With the exception of the check variant all fertilizer variants were against background fertilization with 60 kg P O /ha and 60 kg K O/ha. The 2 5 2 positive reaction from the complex interaction of the tested agronomy factors was best expressed in 2015 – 2409.2 kg/ha, while during the extremely unfavorable year 2016, the effect was only 628.2 kg/ha. The independent and combined action of the mineral fertilization and the year conditions had determining influence on the size of the agronomic effect (AE). The positive effect from the mineral fertilization on the values of AE was accompanied by slight differentiation between the tested fertilization norms. Within this study, the highest mean value of AE was determined after fertilization with N P K – 2274.2 180 60 60 kg/ha. The variation in the mean size of AE depending on the type of previous crop was high – from 900.6 kg/ha (pea) to 2031.2 kg/ha (oilseed rape). The applied agronomy practices caused differentiation in the mean values of AE according to the type of cultivar. The cultivars Kiara (1796.1 kg/ha) and Kalina (1704.5 kg/ha) were with the highest size of AE. They exceeded the AE values of the two standard cultivars Sadovo 1 and Pryaspa by 30.26% and 23.62%, respectively.Averaged for the research, it was found that AE was in positive statistically significant correlation with grain yield and its physical properties.',\n"," 'Agronomy/agriculture and biodiversity (ag & biodiv) communities face several major societal, economic, and environmental challenges that data science approaches will help address. To achieve their goals, researchers of these communities must be able to rapidly discover, aggregate, integrate, and analyse different types of data and information sources. Semantic technologies, combined to open, FAIR data and services, is one of the answers to fully knowledge-driven, and transparent science and innovation. The D2KAB project (www.d2kab.org) aims to create a framework to turn agronomy and biodiversity data into knowledge – semantically described, interoperable, actionable, open – and investigate the scientific methods and tools to exploit this knowledge for applications in agriculture and biodiversity sciences. This project, funded by French ANR (2019-2023), will provide the means –ontologies and linked open data– for ag & biodiv to embrace semantic Web technologies in order to produce and exploit FAIR data and services. To do so, D2KAB will develop new original methods and algorithms in the following areas: data integration, text mining, semantic annotation, ontology alignment and linked data exploitation and visualization.D2KAB project brings together a unique multidisciplinary consortium of 12 partners to achieve this objective: 2 informatics research units (LIRMM, I3S); 6 INRA/IRSTEA/IRD research units at the interface of computer science and ag & biodiv (URGI, MaIAGE, IATE, DIST, TSCF, DIADE) specialized in agronomy or agriculture; 2 labs in biodiversity and ecosystem research (CEFE, URFM); 1 association of agriculture stakeholders (ACTA); and 1 partnership with Stanford BMIR department.

Tropical countries in particular are affected negatively by climate change (CC) which also has a detrimental impact on OP agronomy, whereas the cultivation of OP increases CC. Amelioration of both is required. The reduced ability to grow OP will reduce CC, which may allow more cultivation tending to increase CC, in a decreasing cycle. OP could be increasingly grown in more suitable regions occurring under CC. Enhancing the soil fauna may compensate for the effect of CC on OP agriculture to some extent. The effect of OP cultivation on CC may be reduced by employing reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plans, for example, by avoiding illegal fire land clearing. Other ameliorating methods are reported herein. More research is required involving good management practices that can offset the increases in CC by OP plantations.

The resulting \" plasma-activated liquid \" can meet many applications, including medicine and agriculture. Consequently, a complete experimental set of analytical techniques dedicated to the characterization of long lifetime chemical species has been implemented to characterize tap water treated using cold atmospheric plasma process and intended to agronomy applications. For that purpose, colorimetry and acid titrations are performed, considering acid-base equilibria, pH and temperature variations induced during plasma activation. 16 species are quantified and monitored: hydroxide and hydronium ions, ammonia and ammonium ions, orthophosphates, carbonate ions, nitrite and nitrate ions and hydrogen peroxide. The related consumption/production mechanisms are discussed.

The results revealed that the application of micronutrients either singly or in combination had significant effects on the plant height, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, thousand seed weight, and the seed yield of lentil. The maximum seed production was, however, observed in plots receiving treatment T8, i.e., the combined application of Zn, B, and Mo. Agronomic biofortification also had significantly increased protein content of lentil seeds while affecting the macro and micronutrient content of lentil seed.

Nitrogen (N) trace gas emission pulses produced after wetting dry soils may be important pathways of ecosystem N loss. However, the rates and mechanisms controlling these emissions remain unclear. We tested whether changes in microbial community structure and increased rates of atmospheric N deposition could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by ~ six fold. We measured peak NOx (sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) emissions 12 h post-wetting. NOx emissions remained elevated over 24 h and increased after adding N. In contrast, we measured the highest nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions within only 15 min post-wetting. N2O emissions decreased within 12 h, were insensitive to adding N, and were among the highest reported globally. Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher 16S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site, suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification. Nevertheless, N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site. While microbial communities changed after wetting, these changes were not correlated with N emissions. We conclude that desert soils can produce substantial NOx and N2O emission pulses, but that these emissions do not appear directly governed by changing microbial community characteristics or higher atmospheric N inputs. These findings highlight the importance of gaseous N loss pathways from dryland ecosystems that may contribute to sustained N limitation, with implications for atmospheric chemistry and Earth’s climate.',\n"," \"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To improve understanding of fine-resolution SOC stocks in complex terrain and provide guidance to rangeland SOC inventories, we grid-sampled 105 locations (21-m grid cells) at two depths (0–10 and 10–30 cm) in a 10-ha annual grassland catchment in California's Central Coast Range. Soils were analyzed for bulk density, coarse fragments, SOC and texture. Monthly aerial imagery was acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle to compare surface reflectance during two contrasting years (wet vs. dry) to SOC stocks. We found that the 0–30 cm soil thickness held 3.64 ± 0.71 kg SOC m−2 (mean ± SD) with a range of 1.97–5.49 kg SOC m−2. The 0–10 cm soil thickness stored 47% of the 0–30 cm SOC stock with SOC concentrations twice as high in the 0–10 cm layer (1.40 ± 0.38%) as in the 10–30 cm layer (0.71 ± 0.15% SOC). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models explained 50–57% of SOC variability at 0–30 and 10–30 cm, but only 25% of variability at 0–10 cm. Based on cross-validation tests, MLR outperformed spatial interpolation methods and Random Forest models, best explaining SOC stocks with five environmental covariates: wet-year greenness, mean curvature, elevation, insolation, and slope. Lower hillslope positions, concave landforms, and enhanced wet-year greenness were associated with more SOC, and explained 11%, 24%, and 31% of variability in 0–30 cm SOC stocks, respectively. This study demonstrates that the accuracy of regional-scale SOC mapping of California rangelands benefits from considering microclimatic and topographic controls at the catchment-scale, in addition to broader scale mineralogical and macroclimatic controls identified in previous SOC studies.\",\n"," '© 2020 Domestication and agricultural intensification dramatically altered maize and its cultivation environment. Changes in maize genetics (G) and environmental (E) conditions increased productivity under high-synthetic-input conditions. However, novel selective pressures on the rhizobiome may have incurred undesirable tradeoffs in organic agroecosystems, where plants obtain nutrients via microbially mediated processes including mineralization of organic matter. Using twelve maize genotypes representing an evolutionary transect (teosintes, landraces, inbred parents of modern elite germplasm, and modern hybrids) and two agricultural soils with contrasting long-term management, we integrated analyses of rhizobiome community structure, potential microbe-microbe interactions, and N-cycling functional genes to better understand the impacts of maize evolution and soil management legacy on rhizobiome recruitment. We show complex shifts in rhizobiome communities during directed evolution of maize (defined as the transition from teosinte to modern hybrids), with a larger effect of domestication (teosinte to landraces) than modern breeding (inbreds to hybrids) on rhizobiome structure and greater impacts of modern breeding on potential microbe-microbe interactions. Rhizobiome structure was significantly correlated with plant nutrient composition. Furthermore, plant biomass and nutrient content were affected by G x E interactions in which teosinte and landrace genotypes had better relative performance in the organic legacy soil than inbred and modern genotypes. The abundance of six N-cycling genes of relevance for plant nutrition and N loss pathways did not significantly differ between teosinte and modern rhizospheres in either soil management legacy. These results provide insight into the potential for improving maize adaptation to organic systems and contribute to interdisciplinary efforts toward developing resource-efficient, biologically based agroecosystems.',\n"," 'Author(s): Jinfei Feng, Fengbo Li, Xiyue Zhou, Chunchun Xu, Long Ji, Zhongdu Chen, Fuping Fang * Introduction Agriculture is a main source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1], contributing [...]',\n"," \"Keywords Cold atmospheric plasma; Plasma-activated liquid; Reactive oxygen species; Reactive nitrogen species; Electrical conductivity; Plasma agronomy Highlights * Cold plasma activation of tap water induces modification of ion concentrations. * Production/consumption of ions is influenced by operating in hermetic enclosure. * Electrical conductivity of activated tap water can be deduced from ion concentrations. * Irrigation of lentils seeds with plasma-activated tap water increases plant growth. Abstract Cold atmospheric plasmas are weakly ionized gases that can be generated in ambient air. They produce energetic species (e.g. electrons, metastables) as well as reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, UV radiations and local electric field. Their interaction with a liquid such as tap water can hence change its chemical composition. The resulting 'plasma-activated liquid' can meet many applications, including medicine and agriculture. Consequently, a complete experimental set of analytical techniques dedicated to the characterization of long lifetime chemical species has been implemented to characterize tap water treated using cold atmospheric plasma process and intended to agronomy applications. For that purpose, colorimetry and acid titrations are performed, considering acid-base equilibria, pH and temperature variations induced during plasma activation. 16 species are quantified and monitored: hydroxide and hydronium ions, ammonia and ammonium ions, orthophosphates, carbonate ions, nitrite and nitrate ions and hydrogen peroxide. The related consumption/production mechanisms are discussed. In parallel, a chemical model of electrical conductivity based on Kohlrausch's law has been developed to simulate the electrical conductivity of the plasma-activated tap water (PATW). Comparing its predictions with experimental measurements leads to a narrow fitting, hence supporting the self-sufficiency of the experimental set, I.e. the fact that all long lifetime radicals of interest present in PATW are characterized. Finally, to evaluate the potential of cold atmospheric plasmas for agriculture applications, tap water has been daily plasma-treated to irrigate lentils seeds. Then, seedlings lengths have been measured and compared with untreated tap water, showing an increase as high as 34.0% and 128.4% after 3 days and 6 days of activation respectively. The interaction mechanisms between plasma and tap water are discussed as well as their positive synergy on agronomic results. Author Affiliation: (a) LPP, UPMC Univ.

Corroborating a prior study, new country-level data reveal that farmers in low-income countries strive to close the yield gap when high returns are expected. A return adds value per Ag worker or Ag GDP per capita aka labor productivity. Time series data reveal high correlations for Ag GDP per capita and cereal yields with NonAg GDP per capita for countries, regions and the world, and for country groups based on income, debt, or level of development. In effect, both cereal yields and Ag GDP progress in tandem with that of GDP. Economic history/institutional economics inform that robust GDP growth ensues under conditions of 1) efficient technologies, 2) improved skills and 3) efficient markets. Markets are efficient only to the extent that formal contracts and informal agreements are honored by market participants broadly. There is strong evidence that poor contract compliance is the foremost market inefficiency preventing robust GDP growth. To achieve agronomy resurgence, robust Ag GDP growth, and a higher probability of returns for all market participants, markets must have a high degree of contract compliance.',\n"," 'Février 2020',\n"," '© 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis. Despite a growing civic movement to create spaces for urban agriculture (UA) in U.S. cities, public investment remains both inequitable and inadequate to support the diverse practices and practitioners growing food locally. As a result, outcomes of UA initiatives are uneven, ad hoc, and often the result of resistance and concerted advocacy. This is due, in part, to agriculture not being a standard urban land use designation or central focus of urban policymaking, despite decades of research demonstrating health, food, environmental and educational benefits of growing food in cities. Agroecology is a robust framework for urban food justice advocates and policymakers in the U.S. to identify synergistic ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits of UA. In this paper, we analyze survey responses from 35 East Bay urban farms through an agroecology lens, documenting how the diverse farms form part of a fragile system that produces important spaces of food, community, health, and culture. With land use and affordability challenges rising in contexts like San Francisco Bay Area, we contend that urban agroecology as both scientific mode of inquiry and set of agricultural practices can improve urban food research-action projects aiming to protect urban farms as vital city infrastructure.',\n"," '© 2020 Elsevier B.V. Drip irrigation under plastic film mulching with applications of the N-fertilizer is an excellent agricultural strategy, resulting in saving irrigation water, improving N use efficiency, and increasing crop yield. However, the film residue and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses are the leading cause of non-point pollution in agricultural fields. To promote the development of sustainable agriculture, the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model was first calibrated and then validated using experimental data from 2016 and 2017, respectively, collected in the drip-irrigated sandy field with plastic film mulching (PFM), biodegradable film mulching (BFM), and no film mulching (NFM). Additionally, the NO3-N spatial and temporal distributions, uptake, leaching, and use efficiency (NUE) under PFM, BFM, and NFM with 280 kg ha−1 of the N-fertilizer (the local recommendation) were evaluated using both observed and simulated data. These factors were also assessed under BFM with 210 (75 % of the recommended value) and 140 kg ha-1 (50 % of the recommended value) of the N-fertilizer. The results of numerical simulations were in good agreement with observations, with the RMSE, R2, and NSE during verification being 0.01-0.08 mg cm-3, 0.62-0.87, and 0.68-0.94, respectively. When the same amount of the N-fertilizer (280 kg ha−1) was applied in each treatment, there were no apparent differences in NO3-N concentrations in the soil profile, cumulative NO3-N uptake by corn (CNU), and cumulative NO3-N leaching (CNL) in the 100-cm soil depth between the BFM280 and PFM280 scenarios (the subscript indicates the amount of the N-fertilizer) during the early growing season (Day After Sowing [DAS] of 0–78 in 2016 and DAS of 0–92 in 2017). However, CNU and CNL were higher, and the NO3-N concentrations in the upper soil layer (0−40 cm soil layer) lower in these two scenarios than in the NFM280 scenario. The NO3-N concentrations in the topsoil layer (the 0−20 cm soil layer) in the BFM280 scenario were 3.9 % higher than in the PFM280 scenario during DAS 93–154 in 2017 due to the disintegration of the biodegradable film and 26.3 % lower during DAS 79–155 in 2016 because of intensive rainfall. Additionally, the highest NUE (50.9 kg kg-1, the average value for two years) was found when 75 % of the recommended N-fertilizer (210 kg ha−1) was applied. Therefore, an application of 210 kg ha−1 of the N-fertilizer in the BFM scenario can be recommended for sandy farmland to avoid plastic pollution, increase NUE, and effectively promote the development of sustainable agriculture.',\n"," '© 2019 Dust generation is a world-wide issue due to its serious deleterious effects on the environment, human health and safety, and the economy. Although various dust suppression methods have been used for decades, some critical drawbacks in state-of-the-art technology still remain unsolved, such as short-lasting, ground water impact, and prone to water. This work reports a soil stabilizer based on non-toxic material and forms a ductile and durable double-network in soil, namely “D3 soil stabilizer”, which not only improves soil mechanical toughness of surface soil but also suppresses dust generation. A copolymer comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic components combined with enzyme-induced carbonate precipitation is utilized as an in-situ gelation binder to soil particle. The tunable hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic component ratio minimizes undesirable soil matrix expansion and mechanical strength loss upon experiencing wet-dry processes, while still retains good water affinity. We further demonstrated controllable treatment depth by fine-tuning precursor composition, which is essential to minimize environmental impact. The double-network morphology with carbonate precipitate embedded uniformly in polymer matrix is observed via microscopic imaging. The nature of outstanding ductility, high durability against water, and good long-term stability were supported by systematic unconfined compressive strength (UCS) measurements on treated soil, which show strong inter-particles binding, good retention of peak strength, increased strain at peak strength, and increased toughness after soil samples have experienced wet-dry processes.',\n"," '© 2019 Mediterranean-type ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change and exotic annual species, jeopardizing the native communities and their global biodiversity. In these systems, soil nitrogen (N) limits net primary production, and its availability can be influenced by both of these stressors. To understand the interactive effects of droughts and exotic herbaceous species on soil N, we monitored the temporal variability of soil inorganic N, net N mineralization, net nitrification, and NO3- leaching under native- and exotic-dominated stands exposed to rainfall manipulation plots in a Mediterranean-type shrub-dominated community. Increasing drought severity resulted in the accumulation of soil NH4+ and NO3-, with a more pronounced increase in exotic-dominated plots. Increased net N mineralization and net nitrification and reduced leaching losses were observed as mechanisms of inorganic N accumulation. In comparison to soils under native plants, soils under exotic plants had enhanced leaching losses upon soil rewetting. We propose that distinct traits of exotic annual herbaceous species associated with higher N inputs, faster turnover, and reduced temporal uptake determine the changes in N cycling in response to droughts. Severe droughts and exotic plants may produce a larger, more vulnerable pool of N that is prone to losses while providing a competitive advantage to promote exotic growth in these N-limited ecosystems.',\n"," 'Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a sustainable high-yielding crop that delivers valuable fibres, seeds and psychoactive substances. However, there is a lack of field experimental data on the cultivation of hemp because its production was largely abandoned in the last century. Hemp is now considered as an ideal crop to produce innovative biomaterials, and in particular, the dual-purpose hemp production (fibre + seed) is now the norm in European countries, driven by the shift of a rapidly expanding market for hemp seeds coupled with lower quality fibre requirements for innovative biomaterials. This study brought new information on the agronomy and photosynthesis physiology for the resurging production of hemp, particularly for dual-purpose production in Europe. The effects of important agronomic factors, i.e. cultivar, planting density, and nitrogen fertilization, on the performance of the hemp crop were investigated under contrasting European environments. Based on the experimental data, for dual-purpose hemp production, a planting density of 90–150 plants m-2 is recommended for a monoecious cultivar that gives a long vegetative phase while leaving enough time for seed growth. A nitrogen fertilization rate of 60 kg N ha-1 was generally sufficient in the tested environments whereas further optimization of nitrogen fertilization requires accurate and precise assessment of plant nutritional status. To facilitate assessing plant nutritional status, a critical nitrogen dilution curve was determined for hemp. The responses of leaf photosynthesis to nitrogen content and temperature were quantified using a biochemical model of C3 leaf photosynthesis, based on a complete set of photosynthetic measurements for hemp leaves. Then, by combining measurements and modelling, an upscaling was made from the leaf to the canopy level to analyse hemp’s photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) and water-use efficiency (WUE) in response to water and nitrogen supply. The effect of nitrogen supply level on hemp’s NUE and WUE was largely determined by its effect on canopy size or leaf area index (LAI). The effect of short-term water stress on WUE and NUE was reflected in the stomatal regulation, whereas long-term water stress enhanced leaf senescence, reduced LAI but retained total canopy nitrogen content, and thus resulted in a further increase in WUE. Findings in this thesis provided an improved understanding of the agronomy and photosynthesis physiology of hemp, particularly in relation to the dual-purpose production of hemp in Europe. Such understanding not only provides additional evidence that hemp can be grown as a sustainable crop over a wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions, but also provides essential information for parameterizing crop growth models. Prospects for further research were discussed in view of using the findings in this thesis in combination with a crop growth model to develop strategies for optimization of hemp cultivation and breeding.',\n"," \"The current importance of information as an indispensable resource and the need to form a competent graduate capable of managing it, implies raising the quality of the university graduate.

This study was carried out to understand the effects of zinc (Zn), boron (B), and molybdenum (Mo) on the growth and yield of lentil, and how these elements can help manage soil fertility issues. In this regard, the morpho-physiological traits of lentils (BARI Masur-7) were collected from two experiments receiving the same treatments carried out during consecutive rabi seasons of 2015–2016 and 2016–2017. The experiments were laid out with a randomized complete block design having eight treatments, and was replicated thrice. The treatments were T1 (Control), T2 (Zn2.0 kg ha−1), T3 (B1.5 kg ha−1), T4 (Mo1.0 kg ha−1), T5 (Zn2.0B1.5 kg ha−1), T6 (Zn2.0Mo1.0 kg ha−1), T7 (B1.5Mo1.0 kg ha−1), and T8 (Zn2.0B1.5Mo1.0 kg ha−1). The results revealed that the application of micronutrients either singly or in combination had significant effects on the plant height, number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, thousand seed weight, and the seed yield of lentil. The maximum seed production was, however, observed in plots receiving treatment T8, i.e., the combined application of Zn, B, and Mo. Agronomic biofortification also had significantly increased protein content of lentil seeds while affecting the macro and micronutrient content of lentil seed. These results suggest that any micronutrient deficiencies might lead to a yield loss of lentil, and such a scenario could be avoided by a combined application of micronutrients at a proportionate level.',\n"," 'Septembre 2019',\n"," \"Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have resulted in a tremendous increase in the amount of omics data produced in plant science.

The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD- www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources-such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB-with 10 ontologies-such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLD's objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach.\",\n"," \"La sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle est un défi majeur pour les autorités burundaises et pour ses partenaires au développement, nationaux comme internationaux. De nombreuses initiatives existent au Burundi pour apporter des réponses concrètes aux contraintes liées au développement agricole et rural. L’Union Européenne et ses Etats membres (Belgique, Pays-Bas, France, Allemagne, …) mettent en œuvre des programmes de développement rural, dans une logique de complémentarité.Au Burundi, le paysage institutionnel de l’appui au développement rural est vaste, avec de nombreux acteurs publics et privés, bilatéraux et multilatéraux. Malgré une volonté affichée d’œuvrer en cohérence les uns avec les autres, de multiples interventions non concertées coexistent, ainsi que des chevauchements d’approches et de méthodes d’accompagnement des populations, avec des conséquences souvent négatives en termes de coûts humains et financiers. C’est pourquoi, la DUE (Délégation de l’Union Européenne) à Bujumbura a souhaité confier à l’ATAB (Assistance Technique d’Agrinatura au Burundi) une étude afin de contribuer au renforcement de l'efficacité et de l'impact de l'aide à travers l'harmonisation ou la complémentarité des approches et méthodes de différents intervenants.L’équipe de trois consultants retenus pour la réalisation de l’étude a commencé par rechercher et regrouper tous les travaux disponibles afin d’exploiter la documentation existante et de constituer une base de données préalable sur les différentes approches rencontrées au Burundi.Le présent rapport s’attache en premier lieu à présenter la méthodologie suivie par les experts et le contexte particulier en relation avec le développement agricole et rural. Le Burundi a traversé plus de deux décennies de violences et de troubles avec comme conséquence : la plupart des indicateurs sociaux, économiques et environnementaux du pays se sont fortement dégradés. La dégradation de la situation économique que connaît le pays a contribué à éroder progressivement la capacité de résilience des populations vulnérables et leur capacité à participer au développement.Il convient de souligner qu’en mars 2016, l’Union Européenne (UE), le principal partenaire en matière du développement au Burundi, a décidé de mettre en œuvre des mesures appropriées en application de l’article 96 de l’Accord de Cotonou, ce qui a eu comme conséquence la suspension des appuis directs au Gouvernement du Burundi. D’autres bailleurs européens ont aussi reconsidéré la forme de leurs engagements au Burundi, notamment dans les secteurs du développement rural, de l’agriculture, de la nutrition et du foncier. Malgré le constat de nombreuses contraintes au développement du pays, il ne faudrait pas perdre de vue le potentiel existant qui, pour autant qu’il soit accompagné d’un retour durable de la sécurité et d’une stabilité politique, ouvre au développement agricole des perspectives plutôt favorables. Un travail prioritaire initié par la mission a consisté à contacter les ambassades, la FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) et le PAM (Programme Alimentaire Mondial) afin d’obtenir l’inventaire des projets mis en œuvre au Burundi dans le domaine de la SAN (Sécurité alimentaire et nutritionnelle) ou du développement agricole au cours des cinq dernières années. Au départ de ces informations, nous avons pu contacter différents interlocuteurs actifs sur le terrain et représentatifs des actions conduites dans le domaine du développement rural au Burundi, afin d’obtenir une présentation des approches mises en œuvre soutenue si possible par des documents méthodologiques. Les principales approches/méthodes rencontrées au Burundi et documentées dans le présent rapport se concentrent sur l’intensification des exploitations agricoles afin d’accroître la production, de contribuer à la sécurité alimentaire et à la résilience. Il s’agit des approches suivantes :* PIP : Plan Intégré du Paysan,* EFICC : Exploitation Familiale Intégrée Continue et Compétitive, * CEP : Champ Ecole Producteurs,* EMER : Exploitation Modèle Economiquement Rentable,Les quatre principales approches/méthodes en lien étroit avec l’intensification des exploitations agricoles mises en œuvre au Burundi ont été comparées selon 10 critères distincts. Cela permet d’identifier des similitudes entre les approches CEP et EMER d’une part et PIP et EFICC d’autre part.i)Les deux premières approches (PIP, EFICC) sont davantage orientées sur l’exploitation agricole dans sa dimension « ménage » et sur l’autopromotion avec le souci de développer une résilience en faisant passer le ménage agricole du stade « traditionnel » vers celui de l’entreprise agricole. La théorie du changement est formulée par et pour tous les membres du ménage.ii)Les approches EMER et CEP apparaissent davantage comme le prolongement des méthodes classiques de vulgarisation. Elles sont plus orientées sur une intensification axée sur des filières-produits comme le riz et le lait. Nous avons également jugé utile de considérer l’approche CEF mise en oeuvre au Burundi depuis un peu plus de 2 ans, on peut noter qu’elle est davantage orientée vers l’animateur rural (conseiller agricole) afin qu’il soit en capacité d’intégrer les nouvelles approches de vulgarisation qui passent d’une approche techniciste à une approche davantage centrée sur l’autopromotion pour le changement des pratiques agricoles et du mode de production. Vu que l’approche CEF est d’application trop récente au Burundi, nous avons convenu de ne pas l’inclure dans la comparaison des approches.Dans un deuxième temps, nous avons analysé les différences observées entre la théorie présentée et l’application de cette théorie par les agences de mise en oeuvre. Les approches retenues au niveau du programme « TUBEHONEZA » financé par l’UE et lancé depuis mai 2019, ont fait l’objet d’une attention particulière. Ce programme se traduit par la mise en œuvre de cinq projets chacun étant sous la responsabilité d’un chef de file. Les approches CEP et EFICC se retrouvent dans ces projets alors que les approches EMER et PIP ne sont pas représentées. Il est à souligner également une préoccupation forte liée à l’inclusion du genre dans les approches mais aussi le souci très pertinent de la DUE de ne pas entretenir une forme de non-alignement des interventions sur une zones d’intervention donnée en veillant à un zonage géographique. Toutefois, il faudra bien veiller à ce qu’il n’y ait pas de chevauchements avec d’autres projets financés par d’autres bailleurs sur les mêmes collines. Les travaux des experts ont été complétés par une démarche plus ciblée orientée vers des thématiques ciblées présentées dans le rapport comme études de cas. Ces études de cas ont mobilisé différents chercheurs de l’ISABU (Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Burundi), de l’UB (Université du Burundi) et de l’UEA (Université Evangélique d’Afrique). En outre, le choix des études de cas est justifié par l’existence de travaux de recherche et d’une base de données. Grâce à l’existence de ces données collectées dans le cadre de travaux de doctorats ou d’évaluations de projets, il a été possible d’apprécier les méthodes d’approche mises en œuvre.\",\n"," \"Traditional K-Means based distributed clustering used in wireless sensor networks has limitation of getting stuck into local minima, thus many times results in giving inaccurate cluster partitions. To alleviate this drawback, evolutionary based robust distributed clustering techniques are proposed in this paper. These techniques have the capability to determine the global optima thus results in effective cluster partitioning. A moth flame optimization based method is proposed here which minimizes the intra-cluster distance to determine the optimal partition at every sensor node. A diffusion method of cooperation is employed by sharing the best moth position and corresponding fitness value (intra cluster distance) to the neighboring nodes. To introduce robustness, a weight based method for detection and removal of outliers is employed. In this method a weight based on volume and density is given to each data point for outlier detection, a larger weight is considered as an outlier. The simulation study is carried out on one synthetic and two real datasets. The performance of proposed approach is compared with diffusion particle swarm optimization (DPSO), diffusion whale optimization algorithm (DWOA), diffusion elephant herding optimization (DEHO) and distributed K-Means (DK-Means) in terms of Dunn's index, Silhouette index and time complexity. The minimum average Euclidean deviation of proposed diffusion moth flame optimization is 7.16%, 3.25%, 5.24% and 21.70% lower compared to DPSO, DWOA, DEHO and DK-Means respectively for cook agronomy farm dataset.

S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, the key enzyme of S-nitrosothiol homeostasis, was investigated during plant development and following infection in three genotypes of Solanum spp. differing in their resistance to P. neolycopersici. Levels and localization of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) including NO, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and peroxynitrite were studied together with protein nitration and the activity of nitrate reductase (NR). GSNOR expression profiles and enzyme activities were modulated during plant development and important differences among Solanum spp. genotypes were observed, accompanied by modulation of NO, GSNO, peroxynitrite and nitrated proteins levels. GSNOR was down-regulated in infected plants, with exception of resistant S. habrochaites early after inoculation. Modulations of GSNOR activities in response to pathogen infection were found also on the systemic level in leaves above and below the inoculation site. Infection strongly increased NR activity and gene expression in resistant S. habrochaites in contrast to susceptible S. lycopersicum. Obtained data confirm the key role of GSNOR and modulations of RNS during plant development under normal conditions and point to their involvement in molecular mechanisms of tomato responses to biotrophic pathogens on local and systemic levels.',\n"," 'Luffa cylindrica M. Roem, is commonly called sponge gourd or Egyptian cucumber. In September 2018, several plants showing symptoms of powdery mildew were observed in some fields at different locations in Egypt. Identification and pathogenicity tests indicated that the causal fungus of powdery mildew disease of luffa cylindrica was Podosphaera xanthii. Results of surveyed luffa plants grown at different field localities of northern Egypt, for powdery mildew disease incidence revealed that the maximum record (57.33%) of disease occurrence was recorded in some fields belonging to Beheira governorate followed by, Alexandria and Sharqia (53.67% and 48.00%, respectively). Meanwhile, fewer occurrences were observed in Kafer El-Sheekh governorate (45.33%). We applied biocontrol agents as a foliar spray against powdery mildew in vitro and under field conditions. The effects of some essential oils, organic acid and bioproducts were also studied. All treatments significantly reduced P. xanthii compared to untreated plants. Chaetomium globosum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone or grown on rice straw and/or bagas showed highly reduced disease incidence compared to the other treatment. From the present study it could be suggested that the usage of biocontrol formulated on rice straw might be used as an easily applied, safe and cost effective control method against powdery mildew diseases.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew is a serious disease of economically important hazelnut crop in Turkey. Hazelnut production has been extremely affected by the disease in terms of quality and quantity. The disease is caused by two different fungi, namely Erysiphe corylacearum and Phyllactinia guttata. E. corylacearum has been shown to be the responsible one predominantly for the recent economic damage. The fungi produce a mycelium network on hazelnut plants before they sporulate and visually detected. Early detection of these pathogens is important for management as well as understanding their spread and epidemics. In this study, a PCR assay was developed for the detection of both pathogens from hazelnut plant leaves by targeting their ribosomal DNA genes in their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Two sets of specific primers were designed for the detection of E. corylacearum and P. guttata at an early stage of infection. As a result of PCR, a specific band of 578 bp was observed. The amplicon sequencing confirmed the presence of only E. corylacearum, but not P. guttata. Therefore, this PCR-based test can identify plants that are infected with powdery mildew before they show any visual signs. From there, the infected plants can be treated or removed before the fungus has a chance to produce spores that infect neighboring plants. These results would help tackle the eradication of powdery mildew.',\n"," 'Resistance is the best strategy to manage powdery mildew (Podosphaera pannosa (Wallr.:Fr.) de Bary) of rose. Identification of resistant genes (R genes) from plant species will help in breeding programs. Nucleotide Binding Site - Leucine Rich Repeats (NBS- LRR) is a major class of R gene family in plants. This study reports the identification and molecular characterization of resistance gene analogues from roses maintained at ICAR- Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR). The powdery mildew resistant line IIHRR13-4 was compared with the susceptible commercial cultivar, konfetti. PCR based approaches with degenerative primers based on different conserved motifs of NBS-LRR were employed to isolate resistance gene analogues (RGAs) from rose. Eleven RGAs (IIHRR13-4R1, IIHRR13-4R2, IIHRR13-4R3, IIHRR13-4R4, IIHRR13-4R5, IIHRR13- 4R6, IIHRR13-4R7, IIHRR13-4R8 IIHRR13-4R9 and IIHRR13-4R10) were identified from powdery mildew resistant germplasm line, IIHRR13-4, based on the sequence and similarity to RGAs from rosaceae family and other crops. The major similarity to rose RGAs reported are from Fragaria vesca, Rosa hybrid cultivar, Prunus and Rosa chinensis. RGAs isolated from IIHRR13-4 belonged to Toll Interleukin Receptor (TIR)-NBS-LRR and Non-TIR-NBS-LRR RGAs (Lecine Zipper (LZ) type). Different motifs of RGAs identified were P-loop, RNBS A, kinase 2, kinase 3a, RNBS-D and GLPL of NBS domain. This study reports the existence of resistance at genetic level in powdery mildew resistant genotype IIHRR13-4. These RGAs will be useful for mapping and characterization of R genes in IIHRR13-4 and breeding for improved powdery mildew resistance in roses.',\n"," 'Background: A powdery mildew-resistant cultivar of melon is needed to increase melon yield crops. Meloni is a superior melon cultivar bred through a crossing between ♀ SL-3 and ♂ PI 371795, resulted by the Laboratory of Genetics and Breeding, Faculty of Biology, UGM. This study aimed to determine the level resistance of Meloni to powdery mildew infection and to identify the powdery mildew species that infected Meloni based on morphological characters. Methods: Meloni seeds were germinated and planted in the greenhouse of PIAT UGM. Powdery mildew spores were inoculated into the leaves after ±2 weeks of age. Leaf infected were scored using the gridline every 3 days for 6 weeks. Scoring results were converted to the diseases index score. Furthermore, powdery mildew species was identified using morphological characters. Results: Meloni had a tolerance level of resistance to the powdery mildew infection. Based on the morphological characters with fibrosin bodies, conidia ovoid-shape and the position of the germ tube in the lateral part of the conidia, powdery mildew that infected Meloni was expected as P. xanthii. Conclusions: Meloni can be expected as an alternative to superior melon seeds resistant to pest and disease infections especially powdery mildew.',\n"," 'Biological diversity within a mixture field allows for better use of habitat and agro-technical conditions by the mixtures, which can be seen by higher and more stable yields than varieties sown separately. Our studies were conducted in the growing seasons 2011/2012–2014/2015 as field experiments with four winter barley varieties (Bombaj, Gil, Gregor, Bażant) and three, two- and three-component mixtures (Bombaj/Gil, Bombaj/Gregor, Gil/Gregor/Bażant). Seven different chemical treatments with fungicides were applied. The aim of this study was to compare the different varieties of winter barley with their mixtures for resistance to powdery mildew infection. To achieve this aim the logistic model for the analysis of data was used. Of the varieties under consideration, the best and the most resistant variety was Gregor, while the weakest and the most susceptible to diseases (powdery mildew) was Gil. This variety was also significantly weaker than any of the other mixtures taken into account. Moreover, it was so weak that when it was included in mixtures with other varieties, it weakened these mixtures as well.',\n"," 'The study extracts representative features to train a model with supervised machine learning (ML) to detect powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca macularis f. sp. fragariae) on the strawberry leaves. Powdery mildew (PM) is a fungal disease that greatly affects the production of strawberry and usually infects under conditions of warming temperatures and high humidity. In this research, we report robust models to detect PM using image processing and ML technologies. Three feature extraction techniques (histogram of oriented gradients; HOG, speeded-up robust features; SURF, and gray level co-occurrence matrix; GLCM) and two supervised ML (artificial neural network; ANN and support vector machine; SVM) were implemented using MATLAB. Images were augmented to 1016 images using a four different angle rotation technique to simulate strawberry leaf bundles in the real field. The classification accuracy (CA) to detect PM was highest at 94.34% with a combination of ANN and SURF with 908 × 908 image resolution and with SVM and GLCM at 88.98% with 908 × 908 image resolution. In terms of the extraction time for real-time processing, HOG takes the shortest time to extract features in both ANN and SVM.',\n"," 'Abstract Background The development of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has facilitated targeted mutagenesis in an efficient and precise way. Previously, RNAi silencing of the susceptibility (S) gene P owdery M ildew R esistance 4 (PMR4) in tomato has been shown to enhance resistance against the powdery mildew pathogen Oidium neolycopersici (On). Results To study whether full knock-out of the tomato PMR4 gene would result in a higher level of resistance than in the RNAi-silenced transgenic plants we generated tomato PMR4 CRISPR mutants. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 construct containing four single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the tomato PMR4 gene to increase the possibility of large deletions in the mutants. After PCR-based selection and sequencing of transformants, we identified five different mutation events, including deletions from 4 to 900-bp, a 1-bp insertion and a 892-bp inversion. These mutants all showed reduced susceptibility to On based on visual scoring of disease symptoms and quantification of relative fungal biomass. Histological observations revealed a significantly higher occurrence of hypersensitive response-like cell death at sites of fungal infection in the pmr4 mutants compared to wild-type plants. Both haustorial formation and hyphal growth were diminished but not completely inhibited in the mutants. Conclusion CRISPR/Cas-9 targeted mutagenesis of the tomato PMR4 gene resulted in mutants with reduced but not complete loss of susceptibility to the PM pathogen On. Our study demonstrates the efficiency and versatility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system as a powerful tool to study and characterize S-genes by generating different types of mutations.',\n"," 'Downy mildew, caused by the oomycete Peronospora effusa, is the most economically important disease on spinach. Fourteen new races of P. effusa have been identified in the last three decades. The frequent emergence of new races of P. effusa continually overcome the genetic resistance to the pathogen. The objectives of this research were to more clearly map the downy mildew resistance locus RPF1 in spinach, to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with the resistance, and to refine the candidate genes responsible for the resistance. Progeny from populations generated from crosses of cultivars resistant (due to RPF1) to race 13 of P. effusa (Swan, T-Bird, Squirrel, and Tonga) with race 13 susceptible cultivars (Whale and Polka) were inoculated and the downy mildew disease response determined. Association analysis was performed in TASSEL, GAPIT, PLINK, and GENESIS programs using SNP markers identified from genotyping by sequencing (GBS). Association analysis mapped the race 13 resistance loci (RPF1) to positions 0.39, 0.69, 0.94-0.98, and 1.2 Mb of chromosome 3. The associated SNPs were within 1–7 kb of the disease resistance genes Spo12784, Spo12719, Spo12905, and Spo12821, and 11–18 Kb from Spo12903. This study extended our understanding of the genetic basis of downy mildew resistance in spinach and provided the most promising candidate genes Spo12784 and Spo12903 near the RPF1 locus, to pursue functional validation. The SNP markers may be used to select for the resistant lines to improve genetic resistance against the downy mildew pathogen and in developing durably resistant cultivars.',\n"," 'Highlights: •The soybean derived daidzein was epoxidized to develop a bio-based crosslinker (DDE).•DDE was used to modify soy protein adhesive to form a 100% bio-based wood adhesive.•Using 6% DDE, the dry and wet shear strength of plywood increase by 52.3% and 164.4%.•DDE improves adhesive’s mildew resistance and extends adhesive’s shelf life to 12 h.',\n"," 'Highlights •Magnetic reconstituted bamboo board is successfully fabricated.•Fe3O4 nanoparticles are 3D body loading inside the reconstituted bamboo board.•Fe3O4 nanoparticles are 2D surface loading on the bamboo bundles surface.•Fe3O4 loaded reconstituted bamboo possesses good magnetism and mildew resistance.',\n"," 'Highlights •VdGATA2 is specific expression and is inducible expression by powdery mildew, SA, MeJA and ETH in grapes.•VdGATA2 is localized in nucleus and has transcriptional activation activity in yeast.•VdGATA2 involved in plant disease resistance by H2O2 pathway in Arabidopsis.',\n"," 'Highlights •Bacillus amyloliquefaciens YN201732, a beneficial endophyte isolated from tobacco seeds can control tobacco powdery mildew.•This endophyte can also promote seed germination and seedling plant growth.•Important genes were induced involved in jasmonic acid/ethylene signaling pathway of plant.•Polyphenol oxidase and chitinases are closely related to tobacco induced resistance to powdery mildew.•B. amyloliquefaciens YN201732 has high potential to be used as biocontrol agent in tobacco agriculture.',\n"," 'One of the biggest problems in cucumber cultivation is cucurbit downy mildew (DM), caused by the obligate biotroph Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Whereas DM in cucumber was previously efficiently controlled by the dm-1 gene from Indian cucumber accession PI 197087, this resistance was broken by new DM strains, prompting the search for novel sources of resistance. A promising source of resistance is the wild cucumber accession PI 197088. It was previously shown that DM resistance in this genotype inherits polygenically. In this paper, we put the focus on one of the QTL, DM4.1 that is located on chromosome 4. QTL DM4.1 was shown to consist of three subQTL: DM4.1.1 affected pathogen-induced necrosis, DM4.1.2 was shown to have an additive effect on sporulation, and DM4.1.3 had a recessive effect on chlorosis as well as an effect on sporulation. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) were produced by introgressing the subQTLs into a susceptible cucumber line (HS279) with good horticultural traits. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that many genes in general, and defense pathway genes in particular, were differentially expressed in NIL DM4.1.1/.2 compared to NIL DM4.1.3 and the susceptible parent HS279. This indicates that the resistance from subQTL DM4.1.1 and/or subQTL DM4.1.2 likely involves defense signaling pathways, whereas resistance due to subQTL DM4.1.3 is more likely to be independent of known defense pathways. Based on fine-mapping data, we identified the RLK gene CsLRK10L2 as a likely candidate for subQTL DM4.1.2, as this gene was found to have a loss-of-function mutation in the susceptible parent HS279, and was strongly upregulated by P. cubensis inoculation in NIL DM4.1.1/.2. Heterologous expression of this gene triggered necrosis, providing further evidence that this gene is indeed causal for subQTL DM4.1.2.',\n"," 'Interfacial solar-driven evaporation is an effective and sustainable approach to convert solar energy to heat for desalination. However, maintaining a rapid evaporation rate and long-term stability is a critical challenge that needs to be addressed urgently to facilitate practical applications of this technology. Here, taking advantage of the inherent porosity, wettability, and low thermal conductivity of wood, we develop a flexible and mildew-resistant aerogel derived from natural wood as the substrate of evaporators for stable and efficient solar desalination. The wood-derived aerogel not only possesses good hydrophilicity, low thermal conductivity, and light weight, which are favorable to realize heat localization and efficient water evaporation, but also avoids fragility and mildew problems that seriously restricted long-term stability of wood-based evaporators.

Hence, the experiment was conducted to study the efficacy of fungicides in management of downy mildew disease of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) under open field in Chauradi-7 Dhading during spring season, 2019. Bhaktapur local variety of cucumber was used for the study. The experiment was laid out in single factor randomized complete block design with four replications. Three different bio-fungicides; Trichoderma viride + Trichoderma harzianum, Bacillus subtilis, Verticillium lecanii and one chemical fungicide; Krilaxyl (metalaxyl 8% + mancozeb 64%) were used as treatments. Normal water spray served as control. It was observed that bio-fungicides had insignificant effect in controlling the downy mildew. Pathological observation such as disease incidence percentage, severity percentage and AUDPC in bio-fungicides treated plots were not significantly different from water-sprayed control plots. Similarly, biometric attributes such as number of fruit, length and diameter of fruit, weight of fruit were also non-significant. Krilaxyl resulted significant effect in controlling downy mildew, providing maximum disease reduction (37.48%-50.72%) with lowest disease incidence (1.25-61.25%) and lowest value of AUDPC (138.7). Krilaxyl treated plots had higher number of fruit (6), longer length of fruit (17.15-18.95), higher diameter of fruit (4.16- 4.45 cm) and higher weight of fruit (677 - 759 g). Hence, chemical fungicide Krilaxyl was found better for the management of downy mildew disease in open field cucumber cultivation.

Currently, the researchers from different countries have identified 8 races of broomrape A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The sunflower varieties and hybrids previously developed at the station and introduced into the State List of Breeding Achievements of the Russian Federation that are resistant to the broomrape races A, B, C, D, E were greatly affected. Monitoring of the races of broomrape and false powdery mildew, conducted by the ARRIOC researchers, showed the presence of more aggressive broomrape races (F, G, H) and false powdery mildew (330, 710, 730) in the fields of the Rostov Region. The current situation necessitated the development of sunflower hybrids resistant to the new aggressive races of these pathogens. To identify such hybrids, the corresponding initial breeding material has been required. It was important to combine resistance to broomrape and false powdery mildew with other breeding-valuable traits in one genotype. The current paper presents the results of the sunflower initial breeding material on resistance to broomrape and false powdery mildew. The work was carried out in the fields and in the laboratories of DOS, an affiliate of the FSBSI FSC ARRIOC. The breeding material developed at the station was used as the initial material.

The hybrid combinations developed with its participation (MLG 45/4640, MLG 121/4764, MLG 65/2444, etc.), when estimated on the fields infected by sunflower broomrape, showed a higher resistance to highly virulent races of the pathogen in comparison with the best foreign hybrids.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew is one of the diseases caused by fungal infections that can reduce the production of melon fruit worldwide including in Indonesia. A powdery mildew-resistant cultivar of melon is needed to increase melon yield crops. This study aimed to detect resistance gene linked to powdery mildew using a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. The melon cultivar Meloni was used in this study. SL-3, PI 371795, and Aramis cultivar were used to compare. Amplification of the marker was performed employing a pair of primers. The result showed that Meloni had a powdery mildew resistance gene by the presence of a DNA target band at 1058 base pair (bp). Based on this result, it could be concluded that Meloni was an excellent melon cultivar because of its ability to overcome the powdery mildew infections naturally. SCAR markers have been used for various purposes, especially to detect resistance genes to plant diseases.

Wheat–P. huashanica translocation lines are important intermediate materials for wheat breeding and studying the functions of alien chromosomes. However, powdery mildew resistance in these translocation lines has not been reported previously. Results This study developed a novel wheat–P. huashanica translocation line TR77 by selecting a F7 progeny from the cross between heptaploid hybrid H8911 (2n = 7x = 49, AABBDDNs) and durum wheat line Trs-372. Chromosome karyotype of 2n = 42 = 21II was observed in both mitotic and meiotic stages of TR77. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis identified two translocated chromosomes that paired normally at meiosis stage in TR77. Molecular marker analysis showed that part of chromosome 5D was replaced by part of alien chromosome fragment 5Ns. It meant replacement made part 5DL and part 5NsL·5NsS existed in wheat background, and then translocation happened between these chromosomes and wheat 3D chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated that TR77 carries dual translocations: T3DS-5NsL·5NsS and T5DL-3DS·3DL. Analysis using a 15 K-wheat-SNP chip confirmed that SNP genotypes on the 5D chromosome of TR77 matched well with these of P. huashanica, but poorly with common wheat line 7182. The translocation was physically located between 202.3 and 213.1 Mb in 5D. TR77 showed longer spikes, more kernels per spike, and much better powdery mildew resistance than its wheat parents: common wheat line 7182 and durum wheat line Trs-372. Conclusions TR77 is a novel stable wheat–P. huashanica T3DS-5NsL·5NsS and T5DL-3DS·3DL dual translocation line and showed significant improved spike traits and resistance to powdery mildew compared to its parents, thus, it can be an useful germplasm for breeding disease resistance and studying the genetic mechanism of dual translocations.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Introgression of chromatin from Secale species into common wheat has for decades been a successful strategy for controlling the wheat diseases. The wild Secale species, Secale africanum Stapf., is a valuable source for resistance to foliar disease of wheat. A wheat-S. africanum chromosome 6Rafr substitution line displayed resistance to both powdery mildew and stripe rust at the adult-plant stage. Results Wheat-S. africanum chromosome 6Rafr deletion and translocation lines were produced and identified by sequential non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) using multiple Oligo-based probes. Different ND-FISH patterns were observed between S. cereale 6R and S. africanum 6Rafr. With reference to the physical map of the draft genome sequence of rye inbred line Lo7, a comprehensive PCR marker analysis indicated that insertions and deletions had occurred by random exchange between chromosomes 6R and 6Rafr. A survey of the wheat- S. africanum 6Rafr lines for disease resistance indicated that a powdery mildew resistance gene(s) was present on the long arm of 6Rafr at FL0.85–1.00, and that a stripe rust resistance gene(s) was located in the terminal region of 6RafrS at FL0.95–1.00. The wheat-S. africanum 6Rafr introgression lines also displayed superior agronomic traits, indicating that the chromosome 6Rafr may have little linkage drag in the wheat background. Conclusions The combination of molecular and cytogenetic methods allowed to precisely identify the chromosome rearrangements in wheat- S. africanum 6Rafr substitution, deletion and translocation lines, and compare the structural difference between chromosomes 6R and 6Rafr. The wheat- S. africanum 6Rafr lines containing gene(s) for powdery mildew and stripe rust resistance could be used as novel germplasm for wheat breeding by chromosome engineering.',\n"," 'Abstract Silicon (Si) has been widely employed in agriculture to enhance resistance against pathogens in many crop plants. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Si-mediated resistance remain elusive. In this study, the Arabidopsis-powdery mildew pathosystem was employed to investigate possible defense mechanisms of Si-mediated resistance. Because Arabidopsis lacks efficient Si transporters and thus is a low Si-accumulator, two heterologous Si influx transporters (from barley and muskmelon) were individually expressed in wild-type Arabidopsis Col-0 and a panel of mutants defective in different immune signaling pathways. Results from infection tests showed that while very low leaf Si content slightly induced salicylic acid (SA)-dependent resistance, high Si promoted PAD4-dependent but largely EDS1- and SA-independent resistance against the adapted powdery mildew isolate Golovinomyces cichoracearum UCSC1. Intriguingly, our results also showed that high Si could largely reboot non-host resistance in an immune-compromised eds1/pad4/sid2 triple mutant background against a non-adapted powdery mildew isolate G. cichoracearum UMSG1. Taken together, our results suggest that assimilated Si modulates distinct, multi-layered defense mechanisms to enhance plant resistance against adapted and no-adapted powdery mildew pathogens, possibly via synergistic interaction with defense-induced callose.',\n"," 'NBS-LRR comprises a large class of disease resistance (R) proteins that play a widespread role in plant protection against pathogens. In grapevine, powdery mildew cause significant losses in its productivity and efforts are being directed towards finding of resistance loci or genes imparting resistance/tolerance against such fungal diseases. In the present study, we performed genome-wide analysis of NBS-LRR genes during PM infection in grapevine. We identified 18, 23, 12, 16, 10, 10, 9, 20 and 14 differentially expressed NBS-LRR genes in response to PM infection in seven partially PM-resistant (DVIT3351.27, Husseine, Karadzhandal, Khalchili, Late vavilov, O34–16, Sochal) and 2 PM-susceptible (Carignan and Thompson seedless) V. vinifera accessions. Further, the identified sequences were characterized based on chromosomal locations, physicochemical properties, gene structure and motif analysis, and functional annotation by Gene Ontology (GO) mapping. The NBS-LRR genes responsive to powdery mildew could potentially be exploited to improve resistance in grapes.',\n"," 'Keywords: Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici; BSR-Seq; gain of function; landrace; natural variation; Triticum aestivum Summary Powdery mildew poses severe threats to wheat production. The most sustainable way to control this disease is through planting resistant cultivars. We report the map-based cloning of the powdery mildew resistance allele Pm5e from a Chinese wheat landrace. We applied a two-step bulked segregant RNA sequencing (BSR-Seq) approach in developing tightly linked or co-segregating markers to Pm5e. The first BSR-Seq used phenotypically contrasting bulks of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) to identify Pm5e-linked markers. The second BSR-Seq utilized bulks of genetic recombinants screened from a fine-mapping population to precisely quantify the associated genomic variation in the mapping interval, and identified the Pm5e candidate genes. The function of Pm5e was validated by transgenic assay, loss-of-function mutants and haplotype association analysis. Pm5e encodes a nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) protein. A rare nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) within the C-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain is responsible for the gain of powdery mildew resistance function of Pm5e, an allele endemic to wheat landraces of Shaanxi province of China. Results from this study demonstrate the value of landraces in discovering useful genes for modern wheat breeding. The key SNV associated with powdery mildew resistance will be useful for marker-assisted selection of Pm5e in wheat breeding programs. Article Note: These authors contributed equally to this work.

Loss of resistance in cultivars prompts a continuing search for new sources of resistance. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, WEW), the progenitor of both modern tetraploid and hexaploid wheats, harbors many powdery mildew resistance genes. We report here the positional cloning and functional characterization of Pm41, a powdery mildew resistance gene derived from WEW, which encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat protein (CNL). Mutagenesis and stable genetic transformation confirmed the function of Pm41 against Bgt infection in wheat. We demonstrated that Pm41 was present at a very low frequency (1.81%) only in southern WEW populations. It was absent in other WEW populations, domesticated emmer, durum, and common wheat, suggesting that the ancestral Pm41 was restricted to its place of origin and was not incorporated into domesticated wheat. Our findings emphasize the importance of conservation and exploitation of the primary WEW gene pool, as a valuable resource for discovery of resistance genes for improvement of modern wheat cultivars.

The evolutionarily conserved kinase, Sucrose non-fermenting-related kinase 1 (SnRK1), functions as a metabolic regulator that is essential for plant growth and stress responses. Here, we identify barley SnRK1 and a WRKY3 transcription factor by screening a cDNA library. SnRK1 interacts with WRKY3 in yeast, as confirmed by pull-down and luciferase complementation assays. Förster resonance energy transfer combined with noninvasive fluorescence lifetime imaging analysis indicates that the interaction occurs in the barley nucleus. Transient expression and virus-induced gene silencing analyses indicate that WRKY3 acts as a repressor of disease resistance to the Bgh fungus. Barley plants overexpressing WRKY3 have enhanced fungal microcolony formation and sporulation. Phosphorylation assays show that SnRK1 phosphorylates WRKY3 mainly at Ser83 and Ser112 to destabilize the repressor, and WRKY3 non-phosphorylation-null mutants at these two sites are more stable than the wild-type protein. SnRK1-overexpressing barley plants display enhanced disease resistance to Bgh. Transient expression of SnRK1 reduces fungal haustorium formation in barley cells, which probably requires SnRK1 nuclear localization and kinase activity. Together, these findings suggest that SnRK1 is directly involved in plant immunity through phosphorylation and destabilization of the WRKY3 repressor, revealing a new regulatory mechanism of immune derepression in plants.',\n"," 'Abstract Cucumber powdery mildew disease caused by Podosphaera xanthii (Castagne) U.

This research study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the tested bio-agents, Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride, Bacillus subtilis, Paenibacillus polymyxa, and Serratia marcescens, as well as the fungicide score (Difenoconazole), on cucumber infected with P. xanthii, in vitro and under greenhouse conditions. Results indicated that culture filtrate of the tested bio-agents and the fungicide (control) significantly reduced P. xanthii conidial germination in vitro; the reduction percentage ranged between 91.17 and 76.06%. Also, score recorded the highest reduction percentage (97.19%). All treatments significantly decreased the disease severity and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) post spraying the bio-agents on cucumber plants under greenhouse conditions. Score followed by B. subtilis significantly decreased disease severity percentage (67.33 and 65.38%, respectively) and AUDPC (322.84 and 342.06) than the untreated control (988.13 AUDPC). Additionally, treated cucumber plants showed a significant increase in plant growth parameters (plant height, total chlorophyll, fresh, and dry weight) and yield parameters (fruit number/plant and fruit weight/plant) as well the activity of defense-related enzymes, i.e., peroxidase (PO) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and total phenols content (TPC) compared to the untreated plants.',\n"," 'The downy mildew of basil, which is caused by Peronospora belbahrii, is one of the most devastating basil diseases throughout the world, and management programmes with a limited use of fungicides are necessary to control it. In order to develop efficient integrated disease management programmes, the efficacy of alternative products (calcium oxide, zeolite, orange oil with ascorbic acid, potassium phosphites and bicarbonate), applied in different spray programmes in trials carried out under artificial and natural infestations with the pathogen, has been tested. Various combinations of the treatments were chosen, on the basis of the efficacy of the single products, for further testing in experiments carried out in the presence of natural pathogen infestation and under a reduced crop density. The effect of the tested programmes on downy mildew severity (% of affected leaf area), disease development (AUDPC) and yield (fresh weight of plants) was evaluated. Calcium oxide, K-phosphite and orange oil with ascorbic acid generally provided the most consistent disease control (58%, 40% and 26% efficacy, respectively), when used alone under severe disease pressure, compared to the inoculated control. Spray programmes based on calcium oxide, applied 2 to 4 times, in succession to one application of azoxystrobin, and under a reduced crop density, were the most efficient treatment in the presence of a natural infestation by the pathogen; this IPM programme reduced downy severity as much as 80%, providing the same effect as a conventional chemical programme based on the alternation of azoxystrobin, fluopicolide + propamocarb and mandipropamid.',\n"," 'Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris) is an important cash crop grown in temperate regions for the production of sugar. Fungal leaf diseases often infect the sugar beet crop during the season, causing significant yield reductions. This study aimed at investigating the effect of pre-symptomatic and well-timed fungicide treatments on disease control, yield, and economic profitability. Sixteen field trials were carried out between 2013 and 2016, showing sugar yield increases following fungicide applications in the range of 2–25%, depending on the disease severity and variety. Powdery mildew (Erysiphe betae) and beet rust (Uromyces betae) mainly had a significant impact on the sugar yield. Attacks of ramularia leaf spot (Ramularia beticola) and cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora beticola) were negligible. The impact from different timings and intensities of control measures was compared using two to five applications with a mixture of epoxiconazole + pyraclostrobin. Data did not show a clear advantage of fungicide sprays applied before visible symptoms or higher fungicide inputs used sugar yields. The yield improvement was only significant in one out of 16 cases. The economic return was highest in year with high disease pressure and for more powdery mildew-susceptible cultivars. Different spray intensities showed no economic difference on average. In conclusion, these field trials confirmed that the common practice of two to three applications per year is preferable to more intense spray programs. Scouting the crop during the season for fungal disease and spraying according to the disease pressure can help to minimize fungicide applications.',\n"," 'Highlights •Non-planar rings increased the anti-stress relaxation and anti-fatigue properties.•The thioether and thiourethane endow the mildew proof and self-healing properties.•Anti-stress relaxation, anti-fatigue, anti-fungal and self-healing are integrated.',\n"," 'Highlights •A total of 539 lncRNAs were identified from PM-resistant and -susceptible melon.•Some candidate lncRNAs were related to hydrolysis of chitin, callose deposition.•A total of 42 lncRNAs are targeted by miRNAs, function as miRNA precursors or sponges.•These data provide fundamental support for melon response to PM.',\n"," 'Abstract Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is a crop of major economic importance. However, grapevine yield is guaranteed by the massive use of pesticides to counteract pathogen infections. Under temperate-humid climate conditions, downy mildew is a primary threat for viticulture. Downy mildew is caused by the biotrophic oomycete Plasmopara viticola Berl. & de Toni, which can attack grapevine green tissues. In lack of treatments and with favourable weather conditions, downy mildew can devastate up to 75% of grape cultivation in one season and weaken newly born shoots, causing serious economic losses. Nevertheless, the repeated and massive use of some fungicides can lead to environmental pollution, negative impact on non-targeted organisms, development of resistance, residual toxicity and can foster human health concerns. In this manuscript, we provide an innovative approach to obtain specific pathogen protection for plants. By using the yeast two-hybrid approach and the P. viticola cellulose synthase 2 (PvCesA2), as target enzyme, we screened a combinatorial 8 amino acid peptide library with the aim to identify interacting peptides, potentially able to inhibit PvCesa2. Here, we demonstrate that the NoPv1 peptide aptamer prevents P. viticola germ tube formation and grapevine leaf infection without affecting the growth of non-target organisms and without being toxic for human cells. Furthermore, NoPv1 is also able to counteract Phytophthora infestans growth, the causal agent of late blight in potato and tomato, possibly as a consequence of the high amino acid sequence similarity between P. viticola and P. infestans cellulose synthase enzymes.',\n"," 'Background. Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal) is widespread and harmful in all regions of bread wheat cultivation. Severe development of powdery mildew leads to a decrease in the number and weight of grains. Growing resistant cultivars is the most environmentally friendly and economically profitable method to protect wheat from the disease. Development of such cultivars requires a search for new donors of effective genes controlling the resistance. To expand the genetic diversity of wheat for resistance to B. graminis, wild relatives of Triticum aestivum L., including Aegilops L. spp., are widely used. The aim of this work was to characterize seven Aegilops spp. for effective seedling and adult plant resistance to powdery mildew.Materials and methods. The material of the study consisted of 437 accessions representing 7 Aegilops spp. (Ae. speltoides Tausch, Ae. caudata L., Ae. biuncialis Vis., Ae. tauschii Coss., Ae. cylindrica Host, Ae. crassa Boiss. and Ae. ventricosa Tausch) from the collection of the N.I. Vavilov All-Russian Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR, St. Petersburg). Juvenile resistance was studied when the seedlings were inoculated with the agent of powdery mildew under controlled laboratory conditions; the adult plant resistance, after artificial inoculation of the plants and under natural infection in the fields of Pushkin and Pavlovsk Laboratories of VIR. Complex populations of the B. graminis agent were used for inoculation. The types of response to infection were scored 10 days after inoculation according to a conventional scale.Results and conclusions. As a result of the tests, susceptibility to powdery mildew was shown in all Aegilops accessions of the D-genome group; all the studied representatives of Ae. speltoides, Ae. caudata and Ae. biuncialis were highly resistant to powdery mildew.',\n"," 'Background. Powdery mildew is one of the harmful and destructive foliar diseases of cereal crops, caused by the fungus Вlumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal. Annual harvest losses may reach 10–15%, and up to 30% in an epidemic year. The VIR collection contains rich diversity of wheat, a valuable source of original material for wheat resistance breeding programs.The aim of this study was to generalize the results of long-term field and laboratory investigations on powdery mildew resistance in spring bread wheat of Nordic origin from the VIR collection and search for accessions resistant in all development phases.Materials and methods. Powdery mildew resistance was analyzed in 279 accessions originated from Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark. The tests were performed from 1961 to 2019 against a natural population of the fungus in VIR’s experimental field (Pushkin, St. Petersburg). Field and laboratory studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines developed by VIR.Results. The analysis of the field data on powdery mildew resistance in spring bread wheat accessions against the Pushkin population of the fungus showed that many Nordic accessions were resistant from 1970 till 1990. These data were retested in 2012–2013. One hundred and five accessions of old landraces and modern cultivars of Nordic origin were studied under field and laboratory conditions for their response to a natural population of the fungus. Accessions resistant in all phases of plant development were identified.Conclusion. Swedish cultivars ‘Sunnan’ (k-58177), ‘Canon’ (k-60992), ‘Sober’ (k-61080) ‘Dragon’ (k-61515) and ‘Dacke’ (k-63479) preserved their resistance to the powdery mildew population beginning from 1993.

We used the published genome of P. humuli to predict the secretome and effectorome and analyze the transcriptome variation among diverse isolates and during infection of hop leaves. Mining the predicted coding genes of the sequenced isolate OR502AA of P. humuli revealed a secretome of 1,250 genes. We identified 296 RXLR and RXLR-like effector-encoding genes in the secretome. Among the predicted RXLRs, there were several WY-motif-containing effectors that lacked canonical RXLR domains. Transcriptome analysis of sporangia from 12 different isolates collected from various hop cultivars revealed 754 secreted proteins and 201 RXLR effectors that showed transcript evidence across all isolates with reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values > 0. RNA-seq analysis of OR502AA-infected hop leaf samples at different time points after infection revealed highly expressed effectors that may play a relevant role in pathogenicity. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the differential expression of selected effectors. We identified a set of P. humuli core effectors that showed transcript evidence in all tested isolates and elevated expression during infection. These effectors are ideal candidates for functional analysis and effector-assisted breeding to develop DM resistant hop cultivars.',\n"," \"Grape downy mildew (GDM) is a major disease of grapevine and the date of appearance of its first symptoms is a determinant information for the protection of the vineyard. Probabilistic elicitation of experts has been used here to estimate this date. In 2017 and 2018, 29 experts were elicited to provide probability distributions of dates of GDM appearance between April and June, for different plots. The results of these elicitations show that the experts' forecasts and their uncertainty change over the season with possible consequences on the number of fungicide treatments. The elicited dates tend to be earlier at the beginning of the season and later at the end of the season, with an average difference of about 18 days. In April 2017 and 2018, most of the elicited dates are too early compared to observed dates of GDM symptom appearance. However, this bias becomes negligible in the month of May. Compared to qualitative scoring systems, our results indicate that probabilistic elicitation is a better tool for communicating expert judgments and their associated uncertainties in plant disease risk assessments and epidemiological alert bulletins.\",\n"," 'Sorghum downy mildew (SDM) caused by the Oomycete, Peronosclerospora sorghi ((Weston and Uppal) C.

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying powdery mildew resistance have been studied extensively in various plant species, little is known about these mechanisms in P. lactiﬂora. In this study, we investigated the expression patterns of genes, using transcriptome profiling. During the expressed genes, we mainly focused on key TF genes that exhibited at least a log2 fold change ≥5 difference in expression level.

Powdery mildew is known to be able to cause a significant yield reduction in watermelon. The current study was conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to determine the relative susceptibility of twenty six watermelon varieties (seeded and seedless) and three pollenizers to P. xanthii populations prevailing in Charleston, South Carolina. USVL677-PMS, which is highly susceptible to PM and USVL531-MDR, which is resistant to PM were included as controls. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used each year and plants were rated on a 0–10 scale of increasing disease severity. During all three years, USVL677-PMS was the most susceptible line with the highest values for area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). Disease severity at the last ratings for USVL677-PMS ranged from 61 to 82%. In comparison USVL531-MDR was very resistant to PM based on disease severity (1–3%) and AUDPC. The commercial pollenizers, SP5, SP6 and Lion were all resistant to PM (1–5% disease severity) and had significantly lower AUDPC compared to USVL677-PMS and most other varieties evaluated. Among the red fleshed varieties, Suprema (seedless variety), was relatively resistant compared to other seeded and seedless varieties. Most of the seeded varieties evaluated (e.g. Malali, Black Mama, Mickey Lee) were highly susceptible to PM, however, some were relatively less susceptible (e.g. Declaration) under field conditions. Currently very few to no varieties with high levels of resistance to PM are available and there is a need to develop newer resistant varieties as PM is occurring more frequently during the growing season.',\n"," 'Grape (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most widely cultivated and economically important fruits. Most cultivated varieties of grape are highly susceptible to fungal diseases, and one of the most pervasive is powdery mildew, caused by Uncinula necator. The jasmonate-ZIM domain (JAZ) family proteins are critical for plant responses to environmental stresses. Here, we report the characterization of VqJAZ4, a jasmonate-ZIM domain gene isolated from Vitis quinquangularis, a Chinese wild Vitis species that exhibits high tolerance to several kinds of fungi. Subcellular localization assay indicated that the VqJAZ4 protein is targeted to the nucleus. The VqJAZ4 gene was strongly induced by U. necator inoculation, as well as by the defense-related hormones methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA). The upregulation of VqJAZ4 after inoculation was dependent on its promoter sequences. Expression of VqJAZ4 in Arabidopsis thaliana improved resistance to powdery mildew. Histochemical staining assays indicated that plants expressing VqJAZ4 displayed a larger number of dead cells and stronger reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst than non-transgenic control (NTC) plants. Expression analysis of several disease-related genes suggested that VqJAZ4 expression enhanced defense responses though SA and/or JA signaling pathways. We also found that VqJAZ4-expressing Arabidopsis showed increased susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. Taken together, these results provide evidence that VqJAZ4 may play an important role in response to fungal pathogens in grape, and may represent a candidate for future grape molecular breeding for disease resistance.',\n"," 'DOF proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that play vital roles in plant development and defense responses. However, DOFs have primarily been investigated in model plants, and fairly limited research has been performed on grape (Vitis vinifera). In this study, we isolated and characterized a C2–C2 zinc finger structural DOF gene, VvDOF3, from the grape cultivar Jingxiu. The VvDOF3 protein showed nuclear localization and transcriptional activation ability, indicating that it functions as a transcription factor. The VvDOF3 gene was rapidly induced by exogenous salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and powdery mildew infection. Overexpression of VvDOF3 in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced resistance to Golovinomyces cichoracearum. Expression of the SA-responsive defense-related gene PR1 and the concentration of SA were up-regulated in transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing VvDOF3. Together, these data suggest that VvDOF3 functions as a transcription factor in grape and enhances powdery mildew resistance through the SA signaling pathway.',\n"," 'Inoculation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves with wheat powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) induces the cell death in adventitious roots. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in respond to biotic stress in plants. To study the involvement of ROS and the degree of cell death in the wheat roots following inoculation, ROS levels and microstructure of root cells were analyzed in two wheat cultivars that are susceptible (Huamai 8) and resistant (Shenmai 8) to powdery mildew fungus. At 18 d after powdery mildew fungus inoculation, only Huamai 8 displayed the leaf lesions, while root cell death occurred in both varieties. Huamai 8 had a high level of ROS accumulation, which is associated with increased root cell degradation, while in Shenmai 8, there was little ROS accumulation correlating with slight root cell degradation. The molecular study about the expression levels of ROS scavenging genes (MnSOD and CAT) in wheat roots showed that these genes expression decreased after the leaves of wheat was inoculated. The difference between Huamai 8 and Shenmai 8 on subcellular localization of H2O2 and O2– was corresponded with the different down-regulation of the genes encoding for superoxide dismutase and catalase in two wheat cultivars. These results suggested that ROS were involved in the process by which powdery mildew fungus induced cell death in wheat roots.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew fungi (Erysiphales) are among the most common and important plant fungal pathogens. These fungi are obligate biotrophic parasites that attack nearly 10,000 species of angiosperms, including major crops, such as cereals and grapes. Although cultural and biological practices may reduce the risk of infection by powdery mildew, they do not provide sufficient protection. Therefore, in practice, chemical control, including the use of fungicides from multiple chemical groups, is the most effective tool for managing powdery mildew. Unfortunately, the risk of resistance development is high because typical spray programs include multiple applications per season. In addition, some of the most economically destructive species of powdery mildew fungi are considered to be high-risk pathogens and are able to develop resistance to several chemical classes within a few years. This situation has decreased the efficacy of the major fungicide classes, such as sterol demethylation inhibitors, quinone outside inhibitors and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors, that are employed against powdery mildews. In this review, we present cases of reduction in sensitivity, development of resistance and failure of control by fungicides that have been or are being used to manage powdery mildew. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to fungicides are also outlined. Finally, a number of recommendations are provided to decrease the probability of resistance development when fungicides are employed.',\n"," 'The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) transcription factors (TFs) constitute the largest plant-specific TF superfamily, and play important roles in various physiological processes, including stress responses.

However, studies on Triticum aestivum NAC (TaNAC)s’ role in resistance to the two diseases are still limited, especially in an overall comparative analysis of TaNACs responding or not to fungal stress. In the present study, 186 TaNAC transcripts were obtained from the resistant hexaploid wheat line N9134 under fungal stress, and 180 new transcripts were submitted to GenBank. Statistical results show that 35.1% (54/154) of TaNAC genes responded to stripe rust and powdery mildew in the seedling stage. “Abnormal” coding transcripts of differentially expressed (DE)-TaNAC genes in wheat responding to fungal stress were found in a significantly higher proportion (24/117 vs. 8/69, p = 0.0098) than in non-DE-NACs. This hinted that the alternative splicing of TaNAC genes was active in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation during plant-pathogen interactions. Full-length NAC proteins were classified into nine groups via phylogenetic analysis. Multiple-sequence alignment revealed diversity in the C-terminal structural organization, but the differentially expressed gene (DEG)-encoding proteins enriched in Subgroups VI and VII were conserved, with WV[L/V]CR amino acid residues in Motif 7 following the NAM domain. Our data that showed TaNAC TFs responded to fungal disease, which was affected by expression levels and by the regulation of multifarious transcript variants. These data for TaNAC responses to stripe rust and/or powdery mildew and their numerous structural variants provide a good resource for NAC function–mechanism analysis in the context of biotic-stress tolerance in wheat.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs with more than 200 nucleotides in length, which play vital roles in a wide range of biological processes. Powdery mildew disease (PM) has become a major threat to the production of melon. To investigate the potential roles of lncRNAs in resisting to PM in melon, it is necessary to identify lncRNAs and uncover their molecular functions. In this study, we compared the lncRNAs between a resistant and a susceptible melon in response to PM infection. Results It is reported that 11,612 lncRNAs were discovered, which were distributed across all 12 melon chromosomes, and > 85% were from intergenic regions. The melon lncRNAs have shorter transcript lengths and fewer exon numbers than protein-coding genes. In addition, a total of 407 and 611 lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed after PM infection in PM-susceptible and PM-resistant melons, respectively. Furthermore, 1232 putative targets of differently expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were discovered and gene ontology enrichment (GO) analysis showed that these target genes were mainly enriched in stress-related terms. Consequently, co-expression patterns between LNC_018800 and CmWRKY21, LNC_018062 and MELO3C015771 (glutathione reductase coding gene), LNC_014937 and CmMLO5 were confirmed by qRT-PCR.

One of the most serious diseases that infect squash and cause yield losses was powdery mildew, caused by Podosphaera xanthisii. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Bacillus subtilis, Paenibacillus polymyxa (109 cell ml/1), Trichoderma harzianum, T. album, T. viride and T. hamatum (107 spore ml/l) for controlling disease under greenhouse conditions. Results indicated that all treatments significantly inhibited the conidial germination of P. xanthii than control in vitro and decreased the incidence and disease severity after spraying with the bio-agents on squash plants under greenhouse conditions. The fungicide, Topas-100 (10.0% penconazole “w/v” [(R,S-1-(2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-Q pentyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole]), followed by B. subtilis was highly significant for decreasing disease incidence (2.8 and 5.3%, respectively) and disease severity percentage (3.5 and 4.8%, respectively) than the control. The activities of biochemical changes, i.e., peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and total phenols, were significantly upregulated as results of most treatments. Also, bio-agent treatments caused significant increase in yield characteristics of squash plants such as fruit number/plant and fruit weight/plant than control. B. subtilis recorded the highest increase (110.9% and 98.7%) in fruit number and fruit weight/plant than control.',\n"," 'Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are involved in the transport of lipophilic compounds to the cuticular surface in epidermal cells and in the defence against pathogens. The role of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored LTPs (LTPGs) in resistance against non-host mildews in Arabidopsis thaliana was investigated using reverse genetics. Loss of either LTPG1, LTPG2, LTPG5 or LTPG6 increased the susceptibility to penetration of the epidermal cell wall by Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). However, no impact on pre-penetration defence against another non-host mildew, Erysiphe pisi (Ep), was observed. LTPG1 was localized to papillae at the sites of Bgh penetration. This study shows that, in addition to the previously known functions, LTPGs contribute to pre-invasive defence against certain non-host powdery mildew pathogens.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew (PM) caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the most economically important wheat diseases in China. Almost all commercially cultivated wheat varieties are susceptible to PM disease, especially the commercial spring wheat varieties grown in the Northwestern region of China. Pm21 was identified as one of the most effective resistance gene to PM in China, and many wheat varieties carrying Pm21 have been developed and released in different areas since 2010. In this study, 3 PM susceptible spring wheat varieties (Ningchun4, Ningchun47, and Ningchun50) were crossed with a PM resistant line CB037 (carrying Pm21) which is a wheat-Dasypyrum villosum T6AL·6V#2S translocation line, and were then backcrossed with the three spring varieties as recurrent parents, combining the disease test with molecular marker selection. After five times of backcrossing and four generations of selfing, nine advanced lines with strong PM resistance and good agronomic traits (plant height, grains per spike, one thousand kernels weight, and yield) were developed. These lines were further evaluated using the analyses of Pm21-specific markers and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and tested in a field trial for agronomic traits including grain yield. Results indicated that all the improved lines were similar to their corresponding recurrent varieties except an obvious difference in plant height. Lines NZ39, NZ42, and NZ46 showed an increase in grain yield (by 1.70–9.38%) and one thousand kernel weight (by 0.4–7.3 g). Compared to their respective recurrent parents, lines NZ41 and NZ46 showed improved bread-making quality, displaying optimal application potential in wheat production.',\n"," 'Downy mildew caused by Sclerospora graminicola is the most devastating disease in pearl millet which leads to decrease in fodder and grain yield. Application of nanoparticles has become a major thrust for disease management in agriculture. In this study, green synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles were evaluated for their efficiency to suppress downy mildew. Saponin rich fraction from aqueous extract of Eclipta alba was used to synthesise zinc oxide nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using UV spectroscopy, FTIR, SEM, XRD, DLS and EDAX analysis. Under laboratory and greenhouse conditions, seed treatment with synthesized nanoparticles (NP) significantly enhanced pearl millet seed germination, vigor, plant height, fresh and dry weight of seedlings. In inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis, the zinc content in nanoparticle treated seedlings was found to be higher compared to control seedlings. Sporangicidal assay of ZnO NP showed that 50 ppm of nanoparticle treatment led to plasmolysis and inhibition of spore germination of S. graminicola zoospore. ZnO NP was applied as seed treatment and foliar spray which resulted in 35% reduction in downy mildew incidence in comparison to untreated control. ZnO NP treated seedlings showed high lignification and callose deposition upon downy mildew infection. Analysis of defense enzymes showed that nanoparticle treatment significantly enhanced the activities of peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, lipoxygenase and polyphenol oxidase in comparison to untreated control. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed differentially expressed transcripts of the defense enzymes where the genes were over expressed in treated seedlings compared to low expression in control. These results indicate that synthesized ZnO NP could promote growth and induce systemic resistance in pearl millet against S. graminicola and can be effectively used to manage downy mildew.',\n"," 'Highlights •Initial identification of three Chinese wild grape strains, such as Yunnan-Yuanmou 2, Yunnan-2 and Muzhaling-3, were highly resistant to downy mildew, and could be used as original materials for the breeding of disease-resistant strains.•Expression patterns of key genes in resistant and susceptible grape strains were different and the resistance genes may play a significant role in the resistance of grapevines to downy mildew.•Markers such as RGA1, RGA9 and RGA10 explained the highest phenotypic variation that were expected to be standard markers to apply in disease-resistance production.',\n"," 'Wheat is the most widely grown crop and represents the staple food for one third of the world’s population. Wheat is attacked by a large variety of pathogens and the use of resistant cultivars is an effective and environmentally safe strategy for controlling diseases and eliminating the use of fungicides. In this study, a collection of wild and cultivated tetraploid wheats (Triticum turgidum) were evaluated for seedling resistance (SR) and adult plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and genotyped with a 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to identify new sources of resistance genes. The genome-wide association mapping detected 18 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for APR and 8 QTL for SR, four of which were identical or at least closely linked to four QTL for APR. Thirteen candidate genes, containing nucleotide binding sites and leucine-rich repeats, were localized in the confidence intervals of the QTL-tagging SNPs. The marker IWB6155, associated to QPm.mgb-1AS, was located within the gene TRITD1Av1G004560 coding for a disease resistance protein. While most of the identified QTL were described previously, five QTL for APR (QPm.mgb-1AS, QPm.mgb-2BS, QPm.mgb-3BL.1, QPm.mgb-4BL, QPm.mgb-7BS.1) and three QTL for SR (QPm.mgb-3BL.3, QPm.mgb-5AL.2, QPm.mgb-7BS.2) were mapped on chromosome regions where no resistance gene was reported before. The novel QTL/genes can contribute to enriching the resistance sources available to breeders.',\n"," 'The effect of bio-agent Bacillus subtilus, nano titanium dioxide (TiO2) and Zinc oxide (ZnO) as well as the combination compared with fungicide (Topas100) was investigated under laboratory (in vitro) and greenhouse conditions against powdery mildew disease caused by Podosphaera xanthii. Most of treatments were strong to inhibit the spore germination of P. xanthii. B. subtilus and B. subtilus + nano-Tio2 were the most effective followed by Topas100, B. subtilus + nano-ZnO, nano-ZnO and Nano-TiO2 compared with control. Most of treatments significantly reduced the disease symptoms and diseases severity (%) particularly bio-agent, nano-ZnO and combination of B. subtilus + nano-ZnO, however, the fungicide treatment showed the best inhibition. As a consequence of treatments histo-biochemical and growth parameters of cucumber were changed. Reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide) were accumulated early. Chlorophyll content, catalase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase activities were increased under various treatments, however, electrolyte leakage (EL) was decreased. The growth characters e.g. plant height, leaves number, fresh and dry weight/plant was significantly improved because of treatments.

The information on genes conferring resistance to powdery mildew in wheat cultivars is useful in parental selection. Winter wheat breeding line DH51302 derived from Liangxing 99 and cultivar Shimai 26 derived from Jimai 22 showed identical infection patterns against 13 isolates of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) that causes wheat powdery mildew. DH51302 and Shimai 26 were crossed to a powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Zhongzuo 9504 and the F2:3 families were used in molecular localization of the resistance genes. Fourteen polymorphic markers, which were linked to Pm52 from Liangxing 99, were used to establish the genetic linkage maps for the resistance genes PmDH51302 and PmSM26 in DH51302 and Shimai 26, respectively. These genes were placed in the same genetic interval where Pm52 resides. Analysis of gene-linked molecular markers indicated that PmDH51302 and PmSM26 differed from other powdery mildew resistance genes on chromosome arm 2BL, such as Pm6, Pm33, Pm51, MlZec1, MlAB10, and Pm64. Based on the results of reaction patterns to different Bgt isolates and molecular marker localization, together with the pedigree information, DH51302 and Shimai 26 carried the same gene, Pm52, which confers their resistance to powdery mildew.',\n"," 'Triticum urartu, a diploid wild wheat and progenitor of the A genome of bread wheat, is an important resource for resistance to powdery mildew fungus caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). In the present study we systematically characterized the interaction between the Bgt fungus and T. urartu at the microscopic level. We also tested 227 T. urartu accessions for reaction to Bgt isolate E09 and discovered previously uncategorized powdery mildew resistance in this collection. Pm60 is a CC-NB-LRR type powdery mildew resistance gene that has at least three functional alleles, Pm60, Pm60a, and Pm60b. A marker-assisted screen targeting the Pm60 locus identified a non-functional allele of Pm60a, designated as Pm60a′. A sequence comparison of Pm60a′ and Pm60a revealed that they differed by 58 SNPs and one 3-nucleotide deletion. Based on the sequence variations two molecular markers were developed to differentiate the functional Pm60a allele from the non-functional Pm60a′. Our screen revealed the presence of a previously uncharacterized powdery mildew resistance in T. urartu and provides new insights into the Pm60 locus. We believe that the two molecular markers developed here and new T. urartu resistant accessions will facilitate further identification of novel powdery mildew resistance genes and benefit breeding for powdery mildew resistance.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), caused by Erysiphe cruciferarum, is emerging as major problem in India. All the Indian mustard cultivars presently grown in India are highly susceptible to powdery mildew and so far no resistance source has been reported. In this study, with an aim to identify resistant source, 1,020 Indian mustard accessions were evaluated against E. cruciferarum PMN isolate, at Wellington, The Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, India under natural hot spot conditions. The study identified one accession (RDV 29) with complete resistance against E. cruciferarum PMN isolate for the first time, which was consistent in five independent evaluations. Genetic analysis of F1, F2 and backcross populations obtained from the cross RSEJ 775 (highly susceptible) × RDV 29 (highly resistant) for two season revealed that the resistance is governed by two genes with semi-dominant and gene dosage effect. Further, a new disease rating system using six scales (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) has also been proposed in this study to score powdery mildew based on progress of fungal growth in different plant parts of the F2 population. The outcome of this study viz. newly identified powdery mildew-resistant Indian mustard accession (RDV 29), information on inheritance of resistance and the newly developed disease rating scale will provide the base for development of powdery mildew-resistant cultivars of Indian mustard.',\n"," '1.

Based on the increased expression of MLO in mycorrhizal roots and its presence in a clade of the MLO family that is specific to mycorrhizal-host species, we investigated the potential role of MLO in arbuscular mycorrhizal interactions. Using mutants from barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and Medicago truncatula, we demonstrate a role for MLO in colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Early mycorrhizal colonization was reduced in mlo mutants of barley, wheat, and M. truncatula, and this was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in the expression of many of the key genes required for intracellular accommodation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These findings show that clade IV MLOs are involved in the establishment of symbiotic associations with beneficial fungi, a role that has been appropriated by powdery mildew.

Host resistance is well known to be the most efficient method to control this disease. However, the molecular mechanism of wheat powdery mildew resistance (Pm) is still unclear. To analyze the molecular mechanism of Pm, we used the resistant wheat cultivar Jimai 23 to investigate its potential resistance components and profiled its expression in response to powdery mildew infection using bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq). We showed that the Pm of Jimai 23 was provided by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated PmJM23, and assigned it to the documented Pm2 region of chromosome 5DS. 3,816 consistently different SNPs were called between resistant and susceptible parents and the bulked pools derived from the combinations between the resistant parent Jimai23 and the susceptible parent Tainong18. 58 of the SNPs were assigned to the candidate region of PmJM23. Subsequently, 3,803 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between parents and bulks were analyzed by GO, COG and KEGG pathway enrichment. The temporal expression patterns of associated genes following Bgt inoculation were further determined by RT-qPCR. Expression of six disease-related genes was investigated during Bgt infection and might serve as valuable genetic resources for the improvement of durable resistance to Bgt.',\n"," 'Wheat powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a devastating disease that threatens wheat production and yield worldwide. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21, originating from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum, encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein and confers broad-spectrum resistance to wheat powdery mildew. In the present study, we isolated 73 Pm21 alleles from different powdery mildew-resistant D. villosum accessions, among which, 38 alleles were non-redundant. Sequence analysis identified seven minor insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms and 400 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the 38 non-redundant Pm21 alleles. The nucleotide diversity of the LRR domain was significantly higher than those of the CC and NB-ARC domains. Further evolutionary analysis indicated that the solvent-exposed LRR residues of Pm21 alleles had undergone diversifying selection (dN/dS = 3.19734). In addition, eight LRR motifs and four amino acid sites in the LRR domain were also experienced positive selection, indicating that these motifs and sites play critical roles in resistance specificity. The phylogenetic tree showed that 38 Pm21 alleles were divided into seven classes. Classes A (including original Pm21), B and C were the major classes, including 26 alleles (68.4%). We also identified three non-functional Pm21 alleles from four susceptible homozygous D. villosum lines (DvSus-1 to DvSus-4) and two susceptible wheat-D. villosum chromosome addition lines (DA6V#1 and DA6V#3). The genetic variations of non-functional Pm21 alleles involved point mutation, deletion and insertion, respectively. The results also showed that the non-functional Pm21 alleles in the two chromosome addition lines both came from the susceptible donors of D. villosum. This study gives a new insight into the evolutionary characteristics of Pm21 alleles and discusses how to sustainably utilize Pm21 in wheat production. This study also reveals the sequence variants and origins of non-functional Pm21 alleles in D. villosum populations.',\n"," 'Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely grown crop worldwide. Powdery mildew caused by fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. The present study aimed to identify differentially expressed genes and investigate their expression in response to B. graminis in susceptible (Bolani) and resistant (KC2306) wheat genotypes, using publicly available microarray data set and qRT-PCR analysis. A total of 5760 and 5315 probe sets were detected which 5427 and 4630 by adjusted P-value < 0.05 and 168 and 144 genes based on e-value < 1 × 10–5 cut-off were differentially expressed in susceptible and resistant wheat genotypes, respectively. Among exclusively up regulated genes in the resistant genotype 12 hpi compared to its control, fifteen potential genes that may be responsible for B. graminis inoculation resistance were detected. The results of real time PCR for the candidate genes showed that the genes were upregulated in the resistant genotype 12 hpi compared to its control, which validated the results of microarray analysis. The bZIP, ERF, and ARF1 genes may play an important role in B. graminis resistance. The powdery mildew responsive genes identified in the present study will give us a better understanding on molecular mechanisms involved in B. graminis resistance in different wheat genotypes.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew infection of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a destructive disease that threatens yield and quality worldwide. The most effective and preferred means for the control of the disease is to identify broad-spectrum resistance genes for breeding, especially the genes derived from elite cultivars that exhibit desirable agronomic traits. Jimai 23 is a Chinese wheat cultivar with superior agronomic performance, high-quality characteristics, and effective resistance to powdery mildew at all growth stages. Genetic analysis indicated that powdery mildew resistance in Jimai 23 was mediated by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated PmJM23. Using bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq), a series of markers was developed and used to map PmJM23. PmJM23 was then located at the Pm2 locus on the short arm of chromosome 5D (5DS). Resistance spectrum analysis demonstrated that PmJM23 provided a broad resistance spectrum different from that of the documented Pm2 alleles, indicating that PmJM23 is most likely a new allele of Pm2. In view of these combined agronomic, quality, and resistance findings, PmJM23 is expected to be a valuable resistance gene in wheat breeding. To efficiently use PmJM23 in breeding, the closely linked markers of PmJM23 were evaluated and confirmed to be applicable for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Using these markers, a series of resistant breeding lines with high resistance and desirable agronomic performance was selected from the crosses involving PmJM23, resulting in improved powdery mildew resistance of these lines.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) is one of the main foliar diseases in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.; Hv). Naturally occurring resistance genes used in barley breeding are a cost effective and environmentally sustainable strategy to minimize the impact of pathogens, however, the primary gene pool of H. vulgare contains limited diversity owing to recent domestication bottlenecks. To ensure durable resistance against this pathogen, more genes are required that could be unraveled by investigation of secondary barley gene-pool. A large set of Hordeum bulbosum (Hb) introgression lines (ILs) harboring a diverse set of desirable resistance traits have been developed and are being routinely used as source of novel diversity in gene mapping studies. Nevertheless, this strategy is often compromised by a lack of recombination between the introgressed fragment and the orthologous chromosome of the barley genome. In this study, we fine-mapped a Hb gene conferring resistance to barley powdery mildew. The initial genotyping of two Hb ILs mapping populations with differently sized 2HS introgressions revealed severely reduced interspecific recombination in the region of the introgressed segment, preventing precise localization of the gene. To overcome this difficulty, we developed an alternative strategy, exploiting intraspecific recombination by crossing two Hv/Hb ILs with collinear Hb introgressions, one of which carries a powdery mildew resistance gene, while the other doesn’t. The intraspecific recombination rate in the Hb-introgressed fragment of 2HS was approximately 20 times higher than it was in the initial simple ILs mapping populations. Using high-throughput genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we allocated the resistance gene to a 1.4 Mb interval, based on an estimate using the Hv genome as reference, in populations of only 103 and 146 individuals, respectively, similar to what is expected at this locus in barley. The most likely candidate resistance gene within this interval is part of the coiled-coil nucleotide-binding-site leucine-rich-repeat (CC-NBS-LLR) gene family, which is over-represented among genes conferring strong dominant resistance to pathogens. The reported strategy can be applied as a general strategic approach for identifying genes underlying traits of interest in crop wild relatives.',\n"," 'В статье приводятся названия и синонимы возбудителей мучнистой росы тыквенных культур.

POWDERY MILDEW (Pm) genes are responsible for wheat resistance to Bgt. Recently, a wheat line L699 carrying a novel Pm40 gene which was originated from Elytrigia inermedium, was developed and showed high resistance to Bgt; however, the resistance mechanism of L699 is still unclear. In current study, a range of defense responses were examined in wheat line L699 inoculated with Bgt, using a highly susceptible cultivar CN26 without Pm40 gene as a control. We found that high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were rapidly accumulated and abundant papilla were formed at the infection sites where Bgt conidiospores germinated with abnormal morphology at a high frequency on L699 compared to CN26. Local hypersensitive cell death and defense genes in the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways were then rapidly induced in L699. As a consequence, L699 exhibited no typical disease symptoms, whereas CN26 were fully covered by white hyphae and conidia. These data provide evidence that for the resistance of the wheat line L699 with the dominant gene Pm40 against Bgt, early ROS accumulation and papilla formation acts as dominant penetration resistance, leading to morphological abnormality of Bgt, when defense gene expression in SA and JA signaling and HR response enhance the post-penetration resistance by arresting onset of Bgt.',\n"," 'Copper based fungicides are plant protection products prevalently used in organic agriculture to control several plant diseases. Since copper can have various negative effects on the environment, the amount used should be reduced to the minimum necessary. However, this reduction should not lead to a loss of efficacy, as otherwise the quality and quantity of the yield would be at risk. During this study, a copper sulfate/copper hydroxide mixture was combined with an agent for better adhesion to grapevines. This was achieved by microencapsulation of the active agents into a fat matrix which resulted in the so called CuCaps. Laboratory analysis of dispersibility and particle size proved that CuCaps form an applicable powder, suitable for use in commercial crop protection sprayers. Field experiments demonstrated that CuCaps have an equivalent effect compared to a commercially available copper-based fungicide (CCF). Both, CuCaps and CCF were able to significantly (p < 0.05) reduce disease severity (DS) on leaves and bunches in three independent years compared to an untreated control (UTC). This was even true if the applied amount of CuCaps was reduced by one third to 2 kg copper per year and hectare. Additionally, in the particularly severe P. viticola epidemic of 2016, CuCaps showed a remarkably better effect on flower clusters and bunches compared to the CCF. However, this effect was not statistically significant due to strong variation within the repetitions. Taken together, this study shows that copper minimization by microencapsulation is possible. Considering the restricted use of copper-based fungicides, CuCaps can be a valuable option for organic farmers, especially in difficult years.',\n"," 'The early detection the mildew status of maize kernels caused by fungal infection during storage is essential. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with the deep stacked sparse auto-encoders (SSAE) algorithm was employed to recognize the early mildewed degree of kernels. HSI data of kernels were collected in the spectral range of 400-1000 nm and the mildew status was classified into four grades (health, mild mildew, moderate mildew, and heavy mildew) using the measured fungal spores as the reference. The nonlinear features of the spectra were represented using the SSAE network, and the key wavelengths were selected by variable combination population analysis and random frog methods, which were combined with four classifiers-Softmax, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), ELM, and support vector machine-to establish models for identifying the mildew grades of kernels. The comparative results indicated that SSAE combined with KELM classifier to build the SSAE-KELM model had better identification ability than other models with high total correct recognition rate of 97.36% and 96.84% for the training and testing sets, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.92-1. The different grades were visualized on the images of maize kernels based on pixels-level and object-level.

Under controlled greenhouse conditions, seedling infection types of 9 cultivars, Sids-12, Sids-13, Gemmeiza-3, Gemmeiza-10, Sakha-61, Sakha-93, Sakha-94, Giza-160 and Giza-163 revealed susceptibility to the disease, while 14 cultivars, Misr-1, Misr-2, Sids-1, Gemmeiza-1, Gemmeiza-5, Gemmeiza-7, Gemmeiza-9, Gemmeiza-11, Gemmeiza-12, Sakha-8, Sakha-69, Giza-167, Giza-168 and Giza-171 showed resistance during both seasons. In the field, adult plant infections revealed susceptibility of 8 cultivars, Gemmeiza-3, Gemmeiza-5, Gemmeiza-7, Sakha-8, Sakha-61, Sakha-93, Giza-160 and Giza-163, while 7 cultivars, Misr-2, Sids-13, Gemmeiza-11, Gemmeiza-12, Giza-167, Giza-168 and Giza-171 exhibited resistance during both seasons. These last-mentioned 7 cultivars also showed best resistance in seedling infection tests during both seasons. The highest levels of disease severity were recorded with Gemmeiza-3, Sakha-61 and Sakha-94, while the lowest ones were in Giza-167 and Giza-168 as resistant cultivars. Significant losses in grain yield (1000-kernel weight) were recorded with highly susceptible cultivars, reaching 26.68% in Gemmeiza-3, while insignificant loss was recorded with resistant cultivars, 2.06% in Giza-168. A strong positive correlation was observed between % disease severity and % loss in 1000-kernel weight, recording r = 0.9195 in the first season and r = 0.9402 in the second season. In susceptible cultivars, disease was an important yield constraint. Resistant cultivars may be incorporated in breeding programs to prevent yield losses.',\n"," 'Highlights •HSI and deep SSAE network were combined for recognizing the mildewed status of maize kernels.•The spectral features were represented by SSAE and the optimal wavelengths were selected using VCPA and RF for modeling.•Softmax, ELM, KELM, and SVM were developed based on different spectra features.•SSAE and KELM algorithms were fused and yielded satisfactory performances.•The best SSAE-KELM model was used to visualize the mildewed grades of kernels based on pixels-level and object-level.',\n"," 'Objective Genetic diversity in field crops has important role in breeding programs. The object of this study were to evaluate the genetic diversity and association analysis of morphological traits and mildew disease of wheat germplasm. Material and Method In the research 116 wheat genotypes were assessed for morphologic traits using a lattice design with 3 replications in the research field of Gonbad Kavous University. Plants response to powdery mildew was also evaluated. 10 ISSR and IRAP markers were applied for molecular analysis. Results There was a significant difference between genotypes for all measured traits except 1000 grain weight. In molecular evaluation using ISSR and IPBS markers, 57 bands were amplified where 47 bands were polymorphic. The number of polymorphic bands was ranged from 3 to 6 bands for each primer. The maximum polymorphic bands belonged to PRI-14, PRI 43 and PRI 50 primer. The PIC and MIC values ranged from 0.35-0.88 and 0.62-3.14 respectively. The maximum percent of polymorphism belonged to PRI-13, PRI-14, PRI-43, PRI-20 and PRI-10. The maximum Molecular Index was 3.14 in PRI-7. Cluster analysis was grouped lines into three groups, which genotypes 60 and 786 were the most resistance to Powdery mildew. Association analysis between markers and resistance to powdery mildew revealed that total of 9 primers showed a connection to the character. Conclusion Based on the results of this research, genotypes with acceptable morphological traits and resistance to powdery mildew could be screened for advanced wheat breeding programs.',\n"," 'Background. Currently, the most widespread and harmful disease of cucumber is downy mildew. In this regard, a vitally important trend in cucumber breeding is the development of new cultivars, more resistant to downy mildew, for cultivation in different regions. Solution to this problem requires searching for donors of resistance for use in breeding practice.Materials and methods. The studies were conducted at Volgograd Experiment Station of VIR using conventional methods. The material for the screening was the collection of cucumber genetic resources held by VIR.Results and conclusions. During 32 years of work, 2873 cucumber accessions from VIR’s holdings were screened. As a result, 57 accessions with resistance or relative resistance to downy mildew were identified, i. e. 2.0% of the total number studied. Immune accessions were not found. Among the selected accessions, those with the highest yield are noteworthy: landraces from Azerbaijan (temp. k-3999 and temp. k-4004) as well as the cultivars from China ‘Zungsungerum-oi’ (temp. k-3701), ‘Tianin mini cucumber’ (k-4490), ‘Tian Uzin Yao No. 5’ (temp. k-3840) and ‘Tian Uzin Yang No. 6’ (temp. k-3841). Of the resistant and relatively resistant accessions, 76% were from Southeast Asia. During the years of study, 23 accessions, previously resistant to downy mildew, lost their resistance and suffered severe damage from the disease. Hence, it seems obvious that resistant accessions should be periodically retested for susceptibility to downy mildew. Twenty accessions were selected to form a group of tolerant ones. Of these, ‘Yeo leam sam chuk oi’ (k-4545), ‘Crispy Top F1’ (temp. k-3549) and ‘Pchelka F1’ (temp. k-3981) had the highest average yield.',\n"," 'Polyphenol oxidase partial gene PG-PPO was cloned and characterized from Pennisetum glaucum (pearl millet) which showed 42% identity to a PPO sequence isolated from wheat at the region of Copper B with a score of 40 and e-value of 2.8. Multiple sequence alignment results revealed similarity to polyphenol oxidase (PPO) sequences from wheat, trifolium, lettuce, apricot, tobacco, tomato, pokeweed, apple, grape and poplar especially at the Copper B region of PPO. The 395 bp pearl millet PPO sequence was AT rich (53.3%) and contained the highly conserved amino acids of histidine-rich copper binding sites similar to PPO sequences from other crops. Results also indicated that PPO in pearl millet exists in multi copy. The role of the isolated PPO gene during pearl millet-downy mildew interaction was analyzed and the results showed significantly higher and rapid accumulation of PPO mRNAs in resistant pearl millet seedlings inoculated with Sclerospora graminicola in comparison to the susceptible control, demonstrating that the PPO plays a prominent role in pearl millet defense against pathogens, particularly downy mildew pathogen.',\n"," 'Abstract Background To limit the impact of the downy mildew disease of grapevine and reduce the need to recur to chemical treatments, an effective strategy might be recovering adaptive resistance traits in both cultivated and wild V. vinifera germplasm. Considering that stilbenes represent the most important class of phytoalexins in the Vitaceae, the constitutive expression and transcriptional activation of all the functional members of the stilbene synthase gene family were analysed in a group of nine grapevine genotypes following artificial infection with the oomycete Plasmopara viticola, the causal agent of the disease. In addition, in the same genotypes we analyzed the expression of genes encoding for two transcription factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the stilbene synthase genes, namely VvMYB14 and VvMYB15, and of genes encoding for chalcone synthases. Results Downy mildew incidence and severity ranged from nihil to high in the grapevine genotypes considered, being low to moderate in a subgroup of V. vinifera genotypes. The constitutive expression of the stilbene synthase genes as well as the extent of their transcriptional activation following P. viticola inoculation appeared to be inversely related to the proneness to develop disease symptoms upon infection. In a specular manner, following P. viticola inoculation all the chalcone synthase genes were up-regulated in the susceptible grapevine genotypes and down-regulated in the resistant ones. The infection brought by P. viticola appeared to elicit a co-ordinated and sequential transcriptional activation of distinct stilbene synthase genes subsets, each of which may be regulated by a distinct and specific MYB transcription factor. Conclusions The present results suggest that the induction of stilbene biosynthesis may contribute to the basal immunity against the downy mildew of grapevine, thus representing an adaptive resistance trait to recover, in both cultivated and wild V. vinifera germplasm. During the early stages of P. viticola infection, an antagonistic interaction between flavonol and stilbene biosynthesis might occur, whose outcome might determine the subsequent extent of disease symptoms. Further studies are needed to decipher the possible regulatory mechanisms involved in the antagonistic crosstalk between these two metabolic pathways in resistant and susceptible genotypes in response to P. viticola.',\n"," 'Abstract Jasmonic acid (JA) is an important plant hormone associated with plant–pathogen defense. To study the role of JA in plant–fungal interactions, we applied a JA biosynthesis inhibitor, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DIECA), on wheat leaves. Our results showed that application of 10 mM DIECA 0–2 days before inoculation effectively induced resistance to powdery mildew (Bgt) in wheat. Transcriptome analysis identified 364 up‐regulated and 68 down‐regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DIECA‐treated leaves compared with water‐treated leaves. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs revealed important GO terms and pathways, in particular, response to growth hormones, activity of glutathione metabolism (e.g., glutathione transferase activity), oxalate oxidase, and chitinase activity. Gene annotaion revealed that some pathogenesis‐related (PR) genes, such as PR1.1, PR1, PR10, PR4a, Chitinase 8, beta‐1,3‐glucanase, RPM1, RGA2, and HSP70, were induced by DIECA treatment. DIECA reduced JA and auxin (IAA) levels, while increased brassinosteroid, glutathione, and ROS lesions in wheat leaves, which corroborated with the transcriptional changes. Our results suggest that DIECA can be applied to increase plant immunity and reduce the severity of Bgt disease in wheat fields.',\n"," 'Background Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is a widely cultivated vegetable crop, and its yield and quality are greatly affected by various pathogen infections. Sphaerotheca fuliginea is a pathogen that causes powdery mildew (PM) disease in cucumber. However, the genes involved in the resistance to PM in cucumber are largely unknown. Methods In our study, a cucumber PM resistant cultivated variety “BK2” and a susceptible cultivated variety “H136” were used to screen and identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) under the S. fuliginea infection. Results There were only 97 DEGs between BK2 and H136 under the control condition, suggesting a similarity in the basal gene expression between the resistant and susceptible cultivated varieties. A large number of hormone signaling-related DEGs (9.2% of all DEGs) between resistant and susceptible varieties were identified, suggesting an involvement of hormone signaling pathways in the resistance to PM. In our study, the defense-related DEGs belonging to Class I were only induced in susceptible cultivated variety and the defense-related DEGs belonging to Class II were only induced in resistant cultivated variety. The peroxidase, NBS, glucanase and chitinase genes that were grouped into Class I and II might contribute to production of the resistance to PM in resistant cultivated variety. Furthermore, several members of Pathogen Response-2 family, such as glucanases and chitinases, were identified as DEGs, suggesting that cucumber might enhance the resistance to PM by accelerating the degradation of the pathogen cell walls. Our data allowed us to identify and analyze more potential genes related to PM resistance.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew (PM), caused by Podosphaera xanthii, is a major threat to the global cucurbit yield. The molecular mechanisms underlying the PM resistance of pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata Duch.) are largely unknown. A homolog of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor was previously identified through a transcriptomic analysis of a PM-resistant pumpkin. In this study, this bHLH homolog in pumpkin has been functionally characterized. CmbHLH87 is present in the nucleus. CmbHLH87 expression in the PM-resistant material was considerably downregulated by PM; and abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethephon, and NaCl treatments induced CmbHLH87 expression. Ectopic expression of CmbHLH87 in tobacco plants alleviated the PM symptoms on the leaves, accelerated cell necrosis, and enhanced H2O2 accumulation. The expression levels of PR1a, PR5, and NPR1 were higher in the PM-infected transgenic plants than in PM-infected wild-type plants. Additionally, the chlorosis and yellowing of plant materials were less extensive and the concentration of bacteria at infection sites was lower in the transgenic tobacco plants than in the wild-type plants in response to bacterial wilt and scab pathogens. CmbHLH87 may be useful for genetic engineering of novel pumpkin cultivars in the future.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew (PM) is a prevalent disease known to limit cucumber production worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded molecules that regulate host defense responses through posttranscriptional gene regulation. However, which specific miRNAs are involved and how they regulate cucumber PM resistance remain elusive. A PM-resistant single-segment substitution line, SSSL508-28, was developed previously using marker-assisted backcrossing of the PM-susceptible cucumber inbred D8 line. In this study, we applied small RNA and degradome sequencing to identify PM-responsive miRNAs and their target genes in the D8 and SSSL508-28 lines. The deep sequencing resulted in the identification of 156 known and 147 novel miRNAs. Among them, 32 and six differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were detected in D8 and SSSL508-28, respectively. The positive correlation between DEMs measured by small RNA sequencing and stem-loop quantitative real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction confirmed the accuracy of the observed miRNA abundances. The 32 DEMs identified in the PM-susceptible D8 were all upregulated, whereas four of the six DEMs identified in the PM-resistant SSSL508-28 were downregulated. Using in silico and degradome sequencing approaches, 517 and 20 target genes were predicted for the D8 and SSSL508-28 DEMs, respectively. Comparison of the DEM expression profiles with the corresponding mRNA expression profiles obtained in a previous study with the same experimental design identified 60 and three target genes in D8 and SSSL508-28, respectively, which exhibited inverse expression patterns with their respective miRNAs. In particular, five DEMs were located in the substituted segment that contained two upregulated DEMs, Csa-miR172c-3p and Csa-miR395a-3p, in D8 and two downregulated DEMs, Csa-miR395d-3p and Csa-miR398b-3p, in SSSL508-28. One gene encoding L-aspartate oxidase, which was targeted by Csa-miR162a, was also located on the same segment and was specifically downregulated in PM-inoculated D8 leaves. Our results will facilitate the future use of miRNAs in breeding cucumber varieties with enhanced resistance to PM.',\n"," 'Abstract Soybean is an important oilseed cum vegetable crop, susceptible to various biotic stresses which is attributed to recent decline in crop productivity. The emergence of virulent biotypes/strains of different plant pathogens necessitates the development of new crop varieties with enhanced host resistance mechanisms. Pyramiding of multiple disease-resistant genes is one of the strategies employed to develop durable disease-resistant cultivars to the prevailing and emerging biotypes of pathogens. The present study, reports the successful introgression of two major R-genes, including Rps2 (Phytophthora rot resistance), Rmd-c (complete-powdery mildew resistance) and effective nodulating gene (rj2) through functional Marker-Assisted Backcross Breeding (MABB) in the genetic background of well-adapted and high yielding soybean varieties, CO 3 and JS 335. We have identified several promising introgressed lines with enhanced resistance to Phytophthora rot and powdery mildew. The improved soybean lines have exhibited medium to high level of resistance against powdery mildew and Phytophthora rot as well as displayed effective nodulation capacity. Our study has proven the generation of resistant genotypes to realize the potential of MABB for achieving host plant resistance in soybean. The improved lines developed can greatly assist the soybean breeding programs in India and other soybean growing countries for evolving disease-resistant varieties.',\n"," 'Over the past 15 years, downy mildew became the most destructive foliar disease in cultivated Impatiens species (Balsaminaceae) worldwide. A previous study had revealed that the causal agent was not Plasmopara obducens (Oomycota, Peronosporales) but Plasmopara destructor on Impatiens walleriana, and Plasmopara velutina on Impatiens balsamina. This hints to a relatively high degree of specialization of Plasmopara on Balsaminaceae. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to perform multigene phylogenetic analysis and detailed morphological investigation for several Korean downy mildew samples parasitic to cultivated I. walleriana, and I. balsamina, but also to a northeast Asian wild plant, Impatiens textori. It was revealed that I. textori harbors a new species, which is introduced and described here as Plasmopara elegantissima.',\n"," 'Abstract Nonhost resistance, a resistance of plant species against all nonadapted pathogens, is considered the most durable and efficient immune system in plants. To increase our understanding of the response of barley plants to infection by powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, we used quantitative proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS). We compared the response of two genotypes of barley cultivar Golden Promise, wild type (WT) and plants with overexpression of phytoglobin (previously hemoglobin) class 1 (HO), which has previously been shown to significantly weaken nonhost resistance. A total of 8804 proteins were identified and quantified, out of which the abundance of 1044 proteins changed significantly in at least one of the four comparisons (‘i’ stands for ‘inoculated’)- HO/WT and HOi/WTi (giving genotype differences), and WTi/WT and HOi/HO (giving treatment differences). Among these differentially abundant proteins (DAP) were proteins related to structural organization, disease/defense, metabolism, transporters, signal transduction and protein synthesis. We demonstrate that quantitative changes in the proteome can explain physiological changes observed during the infection process such as progression of the mildew infection in HO plants that was correlated with changes in proteins taking part in papillae formation and preinvasion resistance. Overexpression of phytoglobins led to modification in signal transduction prominently by dramatically reducing the number of kinases induced, but also in the turnover of other signaling molecules such as phytohormones, polyamines and Ca2+. Thus, quantitative proteomics broaden our understanding of the role NO and phytoglobins play in barley during nonhost resistance against powdery mildew.',\n"," \"Podosphaera xanthii, causal agent of powdery mildew disease, leads to significant economic yield losses in the melon. The disease is effective in all melons production areas in Asia, Europe and America outside of Turkey. Although it is said to be taken under control by biological and chemical methods, a complete success cannot be achieved. Therefore, it is important to develop genetically resistant varieties. There are well known and most common three races (races 1, 2 and 5) of the pathogen. In this study, 140 melon genotypes were tested against P. xanthii' race 5 which is the most common race in Turkey and genotypic variation for disease resistance was investigated. Disease tests was performed by conventionally in the climate-controlled compartment while the plants were in the seedling stage , and the disease symptoms were evaluated on the 5th, 10th, and 15th day of the inoculation according to the 1-4 scale. The experiment was conducted with two replicates, and 6 plants in each replicate. The mean scale value of all the genotypes was found to be 2.16 for powdery mildew reaction.

Differential expression analysis indicates that R-gene mediated resistance against Ep involves extensive transcriptional reprogramming. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed host genes and in silico analysis of co-regulated promoters suggests that amplification of PTI, activation of the JA/ET signaling network, and regulation of growth-defense balance correlate with resistance. In contrast, processes that favor biotrophy, including suppression of defense signaling and programmed cell death, and weaker cell wall defenses are important susceptibility factors.

In this purpose, we used UPLC-DAD-MS-based semi-targeted metabolomics to screen downy mildew symptomatic leaves that expressed oil spots (6 dpi, days post-infection) and necrotic lesions (15 dpi) under natural infections in the field. Leaf extract analyses enabled the identification of 47 metabolites belonging to the primary metabolism including 6 amino acids and 1 organic acid, as well as an important diversity of specialized metabolites including 9 flavonols, 11 flavan-3-ols, 3 phenolic acids, and stilbenoids with various degree of polymerization (DP) including 4 stilbenoids DP1, 8 stilbenoids DP2, and 4 stilbenoids DP3. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied as unsupervised multivariate statistical analysis method to reveal metabolic variables that were affected by the infection status. Univariate and multivariate statistics revealed 33 and 27 metabolites as relevant infection biomarkers at 6 and 15 dpi, respectively. Correlation-based networks highlighted a general decrease of flavonoid-related metabolites, whereas stilbenoid DP1 and DP2 concentrations increased upon downy mildew infection. Stilbenoids DP3 were identified only in necrotic lesions representing late biomarkers of downy mildew infection.',\n"," 'This paper proposes to study the potentialities of on-board colour imaging for the in-field detection of a textbook case disease: the grapevine downy mildew. It introduces an algorithmic strategy for the detection of various forms of foliar symptoms on proximal high-resolution images. The proposed strategy is based on structure–colour representations and probabilistic models of grapevine tissues. It operates in three steps: (i) Formulating descriptors to extract the characteristic and discriminating properties of each class. They combine the Local Structure Tensors (LST) with colorimetric statistics calculated in pixel’s neighbourhood. (ii) Modelling the statistical distributions of these descriptors in each class. To account for the specific nature of LSTs, the descriptors are mapped in the Log-Euclidean space. In this space, the classes of interest can be modelled with mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions. (iii) Assigning each pixel to one of the classes according to its suitability to their models. The decision method is based on a “seed growth segmentation” process. This step exploits statistical criteria derived from the probabilistic model. The resulting processing chain reliably detects downy mildew symptoms and estimates the area of the affected tissues. A leave-one-out cross-validation is conducted on a dataset constituted of a hundred independent images of grapevines affected only by downy mildew and/or abiotic stresses. The proposed method achieves an extensive and accurate recovery of foliar symptoms, with on average, a 83% pixel-wise precision and a 76% pixel-wise recall.',\n"," 'Strawberry cropping system relies heavily on proper disease management to maintain high crop yield. Powdery mildew, caused by Sphaerotheca macularis (Wall. Ex Fries) is one of the major leaf diseases in strawberry which can cause significant yield losses up to 70%. Field scouts manually walk beside strawberry fields and visually observe the plants to monitor for powdery mildew disease infection each week during summer months which is a laborious and time-consuming endeavor. The objective of this research was to increase the efficiency of field scouting by automatically detecting powdery mildew disease in strawberry fields by using a real-time machine vision system. A global positioning system, two cameras, a custom image processing program, and a ruggedized laptop computer were utilized for development of the disease detection system. The custom image processing program was developed using color co-occurrence matrix-based texture analysis along with artificial neural network technique to process and classify continuously acquired image data simultaneously. Three commercial strawberry field sites in central Nova Scotia were used to evaluate the performance of the developed system. A total of 36 strawberry rows (~1.06 ha) were tested within three fields and powdery mildew detected points were measured manually followed by automatic detection system. The manually detected points were compared with automatically detected points to ensure the accuracy of the developed system.

These findings indicated that Ml92145E8-9 is non-allelic to either Pm4b or PmLK906. Thus, Ml92145E8-9 is likely to be a new powdery mildew resistance gene on 2AL. New polymorphic markers were developed based on the collinearity of genomic regions of Ml92145E8-9 with the reference sequences of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC). Ml92145E8-9 was mapped to a 3.6 cM interval flanked by molecular markers Xsdauk13 and Xsdauk682. This study also developed five powdery mildew-resistant wheat lines (SDAU3561, SDAU3562, SDAU4173, SDAU4174, and SDAU4175) using flanking marker-aided selection. The markers closely linked to Ml92145E8-9 would be useful in marker-assisted selection for wheat powdery mildew resistance breeding.',\n"," '@@@@Highlights •PS3-induced resistance of grapevine leaves against downy mildew does not affect the plant development.•PS3-induced resistance of grapevine leaves against downy mildew affect the leaf primary metabolism.•PS3-induced resistance of grapevine leaves against downy mildew impacts nitrogen compounds, and sugars to a lesser extent.•Effect of PS3 on the leaf primary metabolism is leaf age-dependent.',\n"," 'Highlights •Three homoeologous members of TaNAC6s show different responsive pattern but confer similar resistance to powdery mildew.•TaNAC6s are involved in both basal resistance and broad-spectrum resistance against Bgt perhaps through JA signal pathway.•The role of NAC6s in the powdery mildew resistance was perhaps mediated by a conserved resistance pathway across species.',\n"," \"Powdery mildew caused by Podosphaera fuliginea, is one of the most important diseases, damaging cucumber's yield worldwide. Among the different controlling ways, management of plant nutrition is an effective method. The present experiment was aimed to study the effects of foliar application of manganese (Mn) on disease suppression and to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which Mn-treated plants resist to fungal disease. Cucumber plants were hydroponically grown and sprayed by MnSO4 alone and in combination with lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) four days before pathogen inoculation. The results showed that the foliar application of Mn reduced the fungal disease severity by increasing of lignin, cellulose and pectin contents of cell wall (CW) and improving of leaf water status. The reduction of disease severity by application of MnSO4, Mn + Lys and Mn + Met, were 40, 33, and 40% compared to control, respectively. The increases of lignin contents at the same treatments were 33, 27, and 36%, respectively. The leaf water potential (LWP) enhanced by foliar spray of above-mentioned fertilizers up to 15, 18, and 17%, respectively. The results of present study revealed that the Mn nutrition could control the cucumber powdery mildew by reinforcing of CW structure and reducing of water loss from infected leaves. The current findings are the first reports elucidating the CW-related defense mechanisms in which Mn has important role. The obtained results have a practical importance either in studies of plant physiology and biochemistry or in agricultural sciences for cost-effective control of powdery mildew in cucumber plants.\",\n"," 'This study investigated the impact of mutation in the HvDWARF gene, encoding C6-oxidase involved in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, on disease resistance of barley against the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei). The mutation results in significant BR deficiency in leaf tissue. Since increase in the BR content by their exogenous application was reported to improve plant resistance to viral, bacterial and fungal infection, we wanted to find out, if lowered content of BR may affect plant resistance to this pathogen. The 527DK mutant carrying the aforementioned mutation and its respective wild type Delisa were inoculated by powdery mildew fungus (Bgh, race A6). However, no symptoms of disease were visually noted neither on 527DK nor on Delisa. Microscopic observations showed that after germination of the conidia the germ tubes started to penetrate, developed appressorium but could not develop further in the two genotypes. The cell wall thickening (papillae) around the penetration was only visible. However, inoculated plants showed changes in some of parameters describing photosynthetic efficiency or water relations. Similarly, alterations in hormonal homeostasis not only between wild type and mutant, but between control and infected plants were observed. Inoculation with the pathogen induced especially accumulation of compounds from auxin group (indole-3-carboxylic acid, oxindole-3-acetic acid, 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid and 5-chloroindole-3-acetic acid). Interestingly, the stronger effect was observed in plants with mutation in the HvDWARF gene. Taking into account that the HvDWARF gene mutation finally did not affect resistance to powdery mildew (no symptoms appearance), we suggest that the conclusion of our study may be of importance for breeding of barley.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew, caused by the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a prevalent disease in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and causes serious yield losses worldwide. We used a map-based approach to clone the major broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene PmCH1357 from wheat breeding line CH1357. PmCH1357 was mapped to a 526 kb region containing only TraesCS5D01G044600. The TraesCS5D01G044600 sequence of the susceptibility allele in Taichung 29 (TC29) was identical to that in Chinese Spring, whereas the sequence of the resistance allele in CH1357 was identical to Pm2a previously cloned from the germplasm Ulka/*8Cc. The susceptibility allele in TC29 contained a 7 bp deletion in exon 1, resulting in loss of 856 of the 1277 amino acids in the predicted nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat containing Pm2a protein. PmCH1357/Pm2a sequence was also isolated from the Chinese wheat landraces and cultivars that were previously reported to possess the resistance gene Pm2b, Pm2c, PmLX66, or PmND399. The PmCH1357/Pm2a resistance allele was present in 10 of 495 accessions in core germplasm and contemporary cultivars from China and the USA. A newly developed diagnostic marker for the 7 bp InDel in the resistance gene can be used to eliminate the susceptibility allele in wheat breeding programs.',\n"," 'Stripe rust and powdery mildew are both devastating diseases for durum and common wheat. Pyramiding of genes conferring resistance to one or more diseases in a single cultivar is an important breeding approach to provide broader spectra of resistances in wheat improvement. A new powdery mildew resistance gene originating from wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) backcrossed into common wheat (T. aestivum) line WE35 was identified. It conferred an intermediate level of resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolate E09 at the seedling stage and a high level of resistance at the adult plant stage. Genetic analysis showed that the powdery mildew resistance in WE35 was controlled by a dominant gene designated Pm64. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and molecular mapping indicated that Pm64 was located in chromosome bin 2BL4-0.50–0.89. Polymorphic markers were developed from the corresponding genomic regions of Chinese Spring wheat and wild emmer accession Zavitan to delimit Pm64 to a 0.55 cM genetic interval between markers WGGBH1364 and WGGBH612, corresponding to a 15 Mb genomic region on Chinese Spring and Zavitan 2BL, respectively. The genetic linkage map of Pm64 is critical for fine mapping and cloning. Pm64 was completely linked in repulsion with stripe rust resistance gene Yr5. Analysis of a larger segregating population might identify a recombinant line with both genes as a valuable resource in breeding for resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew (PM) is a fungal disease occurring in both field and greenhouse conditions worldwide. It infects many plant species and reduces both the productivity and quality of crops. Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an economically important crop. In order to develop a molecular marker that can be used more conveniently in the development of PM-resistant melon using MR-1 melon resources, the previously reported cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was improved with a length polymorphism PCR marker. Two cleaved CAPS markers—BSA12-LI3ECORI and BSA12-LI4HINFI—associated with BPm12.1, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) corresponding to the PM resistance of MR-1, have been reported. In this study, we found that in the BSA12-LI3ECORI CAPS marker specifically, a 41 bp deletion was present in the PCR DNA region of the MR-1 melon genome. A new marker capable of distinguishing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) length polymorphism was produced using insertion-deletion (InDel) information in this region. This PCR-based InDel marker distinguished the genotypes of PM-resistant MR-1, PM-susceptible Top Mark, and their F1 progeny. These results suggest that this InDel marker could be used to develop PM-resistant melon varieties based on MR-1.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew caused by the airborne ascomycete fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) is one of most common diseases of barley (Hordeum vulgare). This, as with many other plant pathogens, can be efficiently controlled by inexpensive and environmentally-friendly genetic resistance. General requirements for resistance to the pathogens are effectiveness and durability. Resistance of barley to Bgh has been studied intensively, and this review describes recent research and summarizes the specific resistance genes found in barley varieties since the last conspectus. Bgh is extraordinarily adaptable, and some commonly recommended strategies for using genetic resistance, including pyramiding of specific genes, may not be effective because they can only contribute to a limited extent to obtain sufficient resistance durability of widely-grown cultivars. In spring barley, breeding the nonspecific mlo gene is a valuable source of durable resistance. Pyramiding of nonspecific quantitative resistance genes or using introgressions derived from bulbous barley (Hordeum bulbosum) are promising ways for breeding future winter barley cultivars. The utilization of a wide spectrum of nonhost resistances can also be adopted once practical methods have been developed.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew (PM, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is a devastating disease for wheat growth and production. It is highly meaningful that the disease severities can be objectively and accurately identified by image visualization technology. In this study, an integral method was proposed based on a hyperspectral imaging dataset and machine learning algorithms. The disease severities of wheat leaves infected with PM were quantitatively identified based on hyperspectral images and image segmentation techniques. A technical procedure was proposed to perform the identification and evaluation of leaf-scale wheat PM, specifically including three primary steps of the acquisition and preprocessing of hyperspectral images, the selection of characteristic bands, and model construction. Firstly, three-dimensional reduction algorithms, namely principal component analysis (PCA), random forest (RF), and the successive projections algorithm (SPA), were comparatively used to select the bands that were most sensitive to PM. Then, three diagnosis models were constructed by a support vector machine (SVM), RF, and a probabilistic neural network (PNN). Finally, the best model was selected by comparing the overall accuracies. The results show that the SVM model constructed by PCA dimensionality reduction had the best result, and the classification accuracy reached 93.33% by a cross-validation method. There was an obvious improvement of the identification accuracy with the model, which achieved an 88.00% accuracy derived from the original hyperspectral images.

Roxb.) and the sponge gourd (L. cylindrica (L.) M. Roem.; syn. L. aegyptiaca), are cultivated widely in Asia by smallholder famers. Both species have significant economic and nutritional importance. However, Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV) and downy mildew (DM) caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis are important biotic constraints to loofah production throughout Asia. Loofah landrace-derived breeding lines, developed at the World Vegetable Center (WorldVeg), were evaluated at the WorldVeg East and Southeast Asia Research and Training Station, Kasetsart University, Kamphaeng Saen, Thailand—where natural epidemics of ToLCNDV and DM regularly occur. The lines were also evaluated for other commercially important horticultural traits such as days to 50% staminate and pistillate flowering, fruit color, fruit bitterness, and market segment classification. Thirteen and 59 lines of ridge gourd and sponge gourd, respectively, were determined to be resistant to both ToLCNDV and DM. These lines covered all market segments of loofah and exhibited variability for all of the evaluated horticultural traits. The results of these evaluations and their implications on loofah breeding are discussed.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici; Bgt) is an important fungal disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide, and results in significant crop damage in epidemic years. Understanding resistance mechanisms could have undoubted benefits in controlling disease and minimizing crop losses. The recent explosion in genomic knowledge and the discovery of noncoding RNAs have led to the idea that long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) might be key regulators of protein-coding gene expression. However, in-depth functional analyses of lncRNAs in wheat remain limited. Here, we evaluated the possible role of lncRNAs in regulating functional genes in wheat responding to Bgt pathogen, using genome-wide transcriptome data and quantitative RT-PCR. Our results demonstrated that both long intron ncRNAs (linncRNA) and long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) play roles in regulating allele-specific genes, including transcription factors, both positively and negatively. The correlation of expression between lincRNAs and flanking functional genes increased as the spacing distance decreased. Co-expression of microRNAs, their target lncRNA and target functional genes showed that lincRNA interacted competitively with functional genes via miRNA regulation. These results will be beneficial for further dissecting molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs functions at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in wheat.',\n"," 'Abstract Background European grapevine cultivars (Vitis vinifera spp.) are highly susceptible to the downy mildew pathogen Plasmopara viticola. Breeding of resistant V. vinifera cultivars is a promising strategy to reduce the impact of disease management. Most cultivars that have been bred for resistance to downy mildew, rely on resistance mediated by the Rpv3 (R esistance to P . v iticola) locus. However, despite the extensive use of this locus, little is known about the mechanism of Rpv3-mediated resistance. Results In this study, Rpv3-mediated defense responses were investigated in Rpv3 + and Rpv3ˉ grapevine cultivars following inoculation with two distinct P. viticola isolates avrRpv3 + and avrRpv3ˉ, with the latter being able to overcome Rpv3 resistance. Based on comparative microscopic, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses, our results show that the Rpv3–1-mediated resistance is associated with a defense mechanism that triggers synthesis of fungi-toxic stilbenes and programmed cell death (PCD), resulting in reduced but not suppressed pathogen growth and development. Functional annotation of the encoded protein sequence of genes significantly upregulated during the Rpv3–1-mediated defense response revealed putative roles in pathogen recognition, signal transduction and defense responses. Conclusion This study used histochemical, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of Rpv3 + and susceptible cultivars inoculated with avirulent and virulent P. viticola isolates to investigate mechanism underlying the Rpv3–1-mediated resistance response. We demonstrated a strong correlation between the expressions of stilbene biosynthesis related genes, the accumulation of fungi-toxic stilbenes, pathogen growth inhibition and PCD.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Podosphaera xanthii is the main causal agent of powdery mildew disease in cucurbits and is responsible for important yield losses in these crops worldwide. Powdery mildew fungi are obligate biotrophs. In these parasites, biotrophy is determined by the presence of haustoria, which are specialized structures of parasitism developed by these fungi for the acquisition of nutrients and the delivery of effectors. Detailed molecular studies of powdery mildew haustoria are scarce due mainly to difficulties in their isolation. Therefore, their analysis is considered an important challenge for powdery mildew research. The aim of this work was to gain insights into powdery mildew biology by analysing the haustorial transcriptome of P. xanthii. Results Prior to RNA isolation and massive-scale mRNA sequencing, a flow cytometric approach was developed to isolate P. xanthii haustoria free of visible contaminants. Next, several commercial kits were used to isolate total RNA and to construct the cDNA and Illumina libraries that were finally sequenced by the Illumina NextSeq system. Using this approach, the maximum amount of information from low-quality RNA that could be obtained was used to accomplish the de novo assembly of the P. xanthii haustorial transcriptome. The subsequent analysis of this transcriptome and comparison with the epiphytic transcriptome allowed us to identify the importance of several biological processes for haustorial cells such as protection against reactive oxygen species, the acquisition of different nutrients and genetic regulation mediated by non-coding RNAs. In addition, we could also identify several secreted proteins expressed exclusively in haustoria such as cell adhesion proteins that have not been related to powdery mildew biology to date. Conclusions This work provides a novel approach to study the molecular aspects of powdery mildew haustoria. In addition, the results of this study have also allowed us to identify certain previously unknown processes and proteins involved in the biology of powdery mildews that could be essential for their biotrophy and pathogenesis.',\n"," 'To investigate powdery mildew resistance in rye (Secale cereale), 397 inbred lines of winter rye were tested for susceptibility to infection with Blumeria graminis f. sp. secalis.

They were next tested for the presence of 4 markers linked to 4 alleles for resistance to powdery mildew, identified earlier in common wheat (Triticum aestivum). We found Pm3a only in 3 susceptible genotypes of winter rye, although this marker is linked to the powdery mildew resistance gene in wheat. The other 3 markers linked to Blumeria graminis f. sp. secalis resistance genes (Pm3b, Pm3c, Pm3d) were found in neither resistant nor susceptible rye genotypes.',\n"," 'Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) is an economically important herb crop. Its production has been severely threatened by the downy mildew disease caused by the obligate biotrophic oomycete Peronospora belbahrii. Deployment of disease resistant cultivars would be the most cost effective, environmentally friendly control strategy. However, transferring resistance found only in wild Ocimum species to sweet basil via traditional breeding has been extremely challenging. To apply cutting-edge biotechnological approaches to breeding for basil downy mildew resistance, it is essential to better understand the molecular basis of basil-P. belbahrii interactions, for which a set of experimental tools, including a sensitive disease assessment method, are required. Here we described a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach to quantify P. belbahrri growth during infection. The approach utilizes two pairs of primers that specifically and effectively amplify the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region of P. belbahrii and basil β-tubulin gene for pathogen detection, and normalization of pathogen DNA relative to plant biomass, respectively. This approach was shown to be able to detect increased pathogen growth during infection time course and differentiate disease levels of different sweet basil cultivars at an early infection stage. This qPCR approach is expected to facilitate the dissection of the molecular basis of basil-P. belbahrii interactions and it can also be used for pathogen detection in propagating materials to ensure the growth of disease-free materials and prevent disease spread.',\n"," 'Highlights •The content of total grain protein was higher under powdery mildew infection.•Powdery mildew caused the decrease in total starch and amylopectin content of grains.•Proteins involved in protein synthesis were overabundant in infected grains.•The abundance of triticin, serpin and HMW-GS were increased in infected grains.',\n"," 'Pea (Pisum sativum, L.) is an important legume crops in the world especially for the cool-season, used both for human food and animal feed having high protein and vitamin content.

Powdery mildew-resistance (Pm) gene Pm21 was first transferred into wheat in the 1980s, by translocating the Heuchera villosa chromosome arm 6VS to the wheat chromosome arm 6AL (6VS·6AL). Recently, new Bgt isolates that are virulent to Pm21 have been identified in some wheat fields, indicating that wheat breeders should be aware of the risk of deploying Pm21, although pathological details regarding these virulent isolates still remain to be discovered. Pm40 was identified and mapped on the wheat chromosome arm 7BS from several wheat lines developed from the progenies of a wild cross between wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium. Pm40 offers a broad spectrum of resistance to Bgt, which suggests that it is likely to provide potentially durable resistance. Cytological methods did not detect any large alien chromosomal segment in the wheat lines carrying Pm40. Lines with Pm40 and promising agronomical traits have been released by several wheat-breeding programs in the past several years. Therefore, we believe that Pm40 will play a role in powdery mildew-resistance wheat breeding after Pm21 resistance is overcome by Bgt isolates. In addition, both Pm21 and Pm40 were derived from alien species, suggesting that the resistance genes derived from alien species are potentially more durable or effective than those identified from wheat.',\n"," 'The wild Chinese grapevines (Vitis spp.) show varying levels of resistance to powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe necator that is an economically important disease of cultivated grapevines (Vitis vinifera).

Here, we studied the cytological responses of three wild Chinese grapevine accessions after they were infected with E. necator (En) NAFU1 in comparison to the susceptible V. vinifera cv. ‘Thompson Seedless’ grape. The hyphal growth and sporulation of En NAFU1 were significantly restricted in wild species compared to ‘Thompson Seedless’, which appears to be associated with early cell wall deposition at the attempt sites, encasement of haustoria, and hypersensitive response-like cell death of penetrated epidermal cells. Moreover, endogenous free salicylic acid (SA) was more abundant in wild Chinese Vitis species than in ‘Thompson Seedless’ under pathogen-free condition. During En NAFU1 colonization, SA conjugates accumulated higher in wild grapevines than in ‘Thompson Seedless’. In addition, the species-specific expression patterns of defense-associated genes during En NAFU1 colonization indicated that mechanisms underlying powdery mildew resistance are divergent among different wild Chinese Vitis species.

The disease causes significant economic losses, especially in the organic sector of the industry where the use of synthetic fungicides is not permitted for disease control. New pathotypes of this pathogen are increasingly reported which are capable of breaking resistance. In this study, we took advantage of new spinach genome resources to conduct RNA-seq analyses of transcriptomic changes in leaf tissue of resistant and susceptible spinach cultivars Solomon and Viroflay, respectively, at an early stage of pathogen establishment (48 hours post inoculation, hpi) to a late stage of symptom expression and pathogen sporulation (168 hpi). Fold change differences in gene expression were recorded between the two cultivars to identify candidate genes for resistance. In Solomon, the hypersensitive inducible genes such as pathogenesis-related gene PR-1, glutathione-S-transferase, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase and peroxidase were significantly up-regulated uniquely at 48 hpi and genes involved in zinc finger CCCH protein, glycosyltransferase, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase homologs, receptor-like protein kinases were expressed at 48 hpi through 168 hpi. The types of genes significantly up-regulated in Solomon in response to the pathogen suggests that salicylic acid and ethylene signaling pathways mediate resistance. Furthermore, many genes involved in the flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathways were highly expressed in Viroflay compared to Solomon at 168 hpi. As anticipated, an abundance of significantly down-regulated genes was apparent at 168 hpi, reflecting symptom development and sporulation in cultivar Viroflay, but not at 48 hpi. In the pathogen, genes encoding RxLR-type effectors were expressed during early colonization of cultivar Viroflay while crinkler-type effector genes were expressed at the late stage of the colonization.

We also tested 227 T. urartu accessions for reaction to Bgt isolate E09 and discovered previously uncategorized powdery mildew resistance in this collection. Pm60 is a CC-NB-LRR type powdery mildew resistance gene that has at least three functional alleles, Pm60, Pm60a, and Pm60b. A marker-assisted screen targeting the Pm60 locus identified a non-functional allele of Pm60a, designated as Pm60a′. A sequence comparison of Pm60a′ and Pm60a revealed that they differed by 58 SNPs and one 3-nucleotide deletion.

The objective of this study was to evaluate powdery mildew severity in rose cultivar ‘Grand Gala’ in response to organic fertilization and the application of alternative products to disease control. The first experiment was set in a factorial arrangement, with 5 alternative products: spraying with water as a control (PA), lime sulfur (CS), neem oil (ON), mixture of sodium bicarbonate and canola oil (BC) and coffee pyroligneous acid (APC) and 2 organic fertilizers: chicken manure (EA) and biofertilizer based on banana stalk (B). Disease severity was assessed at 0, 15, 30 and 45 days after the treatments. In the second experiment, asymptomatic leaves or with different powdery mildew severity levels were sprayed only once with the same alternative products mentioned above. Severity was assessed at 0, 7 and 14 days. The organic fertilizations did not influence the reduction in powdery mildew severity in rose. At 45 days, APC yielded a greater reduction in disease severity (81.6%), followed by treatments based on BC, ON and CS. Greater reduction in disease severity in experiment 2 occurred in the treatments of BC and CS, followed by APC. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that APC and the BC have the potential to control rose powdery mildew in an organic cultivation system.',\n"," 'Abstract The environment is the key factor that influences the host-parasite relationship. Elevated CO2 levels resulting from various anthropogenic sources may directly affect the surroundings around pathogens and plants. It is hypothesized that plants may respond differently to pathogens in the environment containing an elevated concentration of CO2. To test the hypothesis an experiment was conducted to examine the effects of intermittent exposures of elevated levels of CO2 viz., 400, 500 and 600 ppm (5 hr/day on alternate days) on the development of Sphaerotheca fuliginea causing powdery mildew disease on five cucurbits species using open-top chambers. The elevated levels of CO2 acted as a growth promoter and significantly enhanced the plant growth of all five cucurbit species. Inoculation with the fungus incited specific mildew symptoms on the leaves and decreased the plant growth and biomass production of the cucurbits tested except bitter gourd. The intermittent exposures with elevated levels of CO2 aggravated the disease development. As a result, severe mildew developed on all five cucurbits, including bitter gourd, which expressed tolerance to the pathogen. Fungus colonization in terms of the number of conidia/cm2 leaf surface was significantly greater on the plants exposed to 500 or 600 ppm CO2. The stomata and trichome density and stomatal pore width were increased in the leaves of CO2 exposed plants. The CO2 exposures also accelerated the photosynthesis rate, but transpiration, stomatal conductance, salicylic acid and total phenols were decreased; fungus inoculation caused the effects just reverse of CO2. Interaction between S. fuliginea and CO2 was found synergistic at 500 ppm, whereas with rest of the concentrations it was near to additive.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Powdery mildew (PM) is an important disease of pea that reduce yield. Ascophyllum nodosum extract (ANE) and chitosan (CHT) are biostimulants used to improve plant health. Efficacy of ANE and CHT was assessed individually and in combination against pea powdery mildew. Results Combined applications of ANE and CHT had a significant inhibitory effect on pathogen development and it reduced disease severity to 35%, as compared to control (90.5%). The combination of ANE and CHT enhanced the activity of plant defense enzymes; phenylalanine ammonia lyases (PAL), peroxidase (PO) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Further, the treatment increased the expression of a number of plant defense genes in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway such as LOX1 and COI and salicylic acid (SA)-mediated signaling pathway such as NPR1 and PR1. Other genes involved in defense mechanisms like NADPH oxidase and C4H were also upregulated by the combination treatment. Conclusion The combination of ANE and CHT suppresses pea powdery mildew largely by modulating JA and SA-mediated signaling pathways.',\n"," 'In recent years, some official reports, to produce best products regarding quality, quantity and economic conditions, recommend that the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information and Communications Technology (ICT) realm. In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization.Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production.In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés (Castelló, Spain).',\n"," 'Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, the pathogen that causes wheat powdery mildew, is one of the most important diseases affecting wheat production in China, and the oversummering is the key stage of wheat powdery mildew epidemic. The more oversummering regionalization of wheat powdery mildew has played an important role in disease prediction, prevention and control. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between oversummering data of wheat powdery mildew and the meteorological factors over the past years, and determined that temperature was the key meteorological factor influencing oversummering of wheat powdery mildew. The average temperature at which wheat powdery mildew growth was terminated (26.2°C) was used as the threshold temperature to regionalize the oversummering range of wheat powdery mildew. This regionalization was done using the GIS ordinary kriging method combined with the Digital Elevation model (DEM) of China. The results showed that annual probability of oversummering region based on Model 26.2 were consistent with the actual survey of the more summer wheat powdery mildew. Wheat powdery mildew oversummering regions in China mainly cover mountainous or high-altitude areas, and these regions form a narrow north-south oversummering zone. Oversummering regions of wheat powdery mildew is mainly concentrated in the high-altitude wheat growing areas, including northern and southern Yunnan, northwestern Guizhou, northern and southern Sichuan, northern and southern Chongqing, eastern and southern Gansu, southeastern Ningxia, northern and southern Shaanxi, central Shanxi, western Hubei, western Henan, northern and western Hebei, western Liaoning, eastern Tibet, eastern Qinghai, western Xinjiang and other regions of China.',\n"," 'We evaluated the effect of different light combinations on powdery mildew resistance and growth of melon seedlings. Light-emitting diodes were used as the light source and there were five light combinations: white light (420–680 nm); blue light (460 nm); red light (635 nm); RB31 (ratio of red and blue light, 3: 1); and RB71 (ratio of red and blue light, 7: 1). Compared with other treatments, blue light significantly decreased the incidence of powdery mildew in leaves of melon seedlings. Under blue light, H2O2 showed higher accumulation, and the content of phenolics, flavonoid and tannins, as well as expression of the genes involved in synthesis of these substances, significantly increased compared with other treatments before and after infection. Lignin content and expression of the genes related to its synthesis were also induced by blue light before infection. Melon irradiated with RB31 light showed the best growth parameters. Compared with white light, red light and RB71, RB31 showed higher accumulation of lignin and lower incidence of powdery mildew. We conclude that blue light increases melon resistance to powdery mildew, which is dependent on the induction of secondary metabolism that may be related to H2O2 accumulation before infection. Induction of tolerance of melon seeds to powdery mildew by RB31 is due to higher levels of sucrose metabolism and accumulation of lignin.',\n"," 'Purpose: Vegetation plays a very important role in industrial regions in terms of not only air purification, but also oxygen enrichment, air humidity, and city aesthetics. The paper presents the authors’ study of oleaster mildew during 2012–2013 in the cities of Pavlodar, Ekibastuz, and Aksu. Method: The species composition of mildew, patterns of its growth and reproduction, seasonal dynamics, and the level of trees infection according to a six-score scale were determined. Result: Three cultivars of mildew from three genera were registered. The species composition of mildew of oleaster is studied for the first time in large industrial cities of the Pavlodar region. The comparative analysis of the systematic structure of phytopathogenic fungi was followed by the study of the micro flora of green planting in megalopolises. The seasonal dynamics of growth, development, and reproduction was determined. The impact of pests on host-plants was studied. Conclusion: Timely diagnosis and localization of disease outbreak increases the likelihood of successful treatment and saving of plants.',\n"," 'Abstract Background The glyoxalase system usually comprises two enzymes, glyoxalase I (GLYI) and glyoxalase II (GLYII). This system converts cytotoxic methylglyoxal (MG) into non-toxic D-lactate in the presence of reduced glutathione (GSH) in two enzymatic steps. Recently, a novel type of glyoxalase III (GLYIII) activity has observed in Escherichia coli that can detoxify MG into D-lactate directly, in one step, without a cofactor. Investigation of the glyoxalase enzymes of a number of plant species shows the importance of their roles in response both to abiotic and to biotic stresses. Until now, glyoxalase gene families have been identified in the genomes of four plants, Arabidopsis, Oryza sativa, Glycine max and Medicago truncatula but no similar study has been done with the grapevine Vitis vinifera L. Results In this study, four GLYI-like, two GLYII-like and three GLYIII-like genes are identified from the genome database of grape. All these genes were analysed in detail, including their chromosomal locations, phylogenetic relationships, exon-intron distributions, protein domain organisations and the presence of conserved binding sites. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis (qRT-PCR), the expression profiles of these genes were analysed in different tissues of grape, and also when under infection stress from downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola). The study reveals that most VvGLY-like genes had higher expressions in stem, leaf, tendril and ovule but lower expressions in the flower. In addition, most of the VvGLY-like gene members were P. viticola responsive with high expressions 6-12 h and 96-120 h after inoculation. However, VvGLYI-like1 was highly expressed 48 h after inoculation, similar to VvPR1 and VvNPR1 which are involved in the defence response. Conclusions This study identified the GLYI-like, GLYII-like and GLYIII-like full gene families of the grapevine. Based on a phylogenetic analysis and the presence of conserved binding sites, we speculate that these glyoxalase-like genes in grape encode active glyoxalases. Moreover, our study provides a basis for discussing the roles of VvGLYI-like, VvGLYII-like and VvGLYIII-like genes in grape’s response to downy mildew infection. Our results shed light on the selection of candidate genes for downy mildew tolerance in grape and lay the foundation for further functional investigations of these glyoxalase genes.',\n"," 'Downy mildew caused by Peronosclerospora maydis is an important disease in the centers of corn cultivation in Java. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a combination of metalaxyl fungicide and varieties that have a high sustainability of downy mildew caused by P. maydis. The study was conducted in Kediri, East Java, which is an endemic area of downy mildew caused by P. maydis. The Split Plot Design with 3 replications was used in this study. The main plots were 5 corn varieties (1) Bima-3 Bantimurung, (2) Bima-20 URI, (3) Lagaligo, (4) Bima-15 Sayang, and (5) Anoman as a susceptible check. The subplots were 5 levels of seed treatment dose with metalaxyl fungicide (0 g/kg, 2 g/kg, 3 g/kg, 5 g/kg, and 7 g/kg seeds). The combination of resistant varieties with metalaxyl at a dose level of 5 g and 7 g/kg of corn seeds was effective in controlling downy mildew caused by P. maydis. In Bima-3 varieties Bantimurung and Lagaligo showed low infection reactions of 7.7-8.1%, and 10.4–11.2% respectively. In a combination of treatment conditions of susceptible varieties (Anoman) with 2, 3, 5 and 7 g/kg seeds, disease incidence reach 100% or most of the plants die. The lower incidence was also followed by yield, ear length and weight of a 1000 seeds that higher than other treatments. The combination of the use of susceptible variety with 2 g to 7 g/kg of metallaxyl doses was not effective in controlling downy mildew caused by P. maydis.',\n"," 'Highlights •Comparative transcriptome analysis was firstly used to study the interaction between melon and powdery mildew.•A number of key genes and pathways involved in biotic resistance to powdery mildew were identified in this study.•This study may provide a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms of melon resistance to powdery mildew.',\n"," '1.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing wheat defense to Bgt are still not well understood. Here we found that TuACO3, encoding the 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase functioning in ethylene (ET) biosynthesis, was induced by Bgt infection of the einkorn wheat Triticum urartu, which was accompanied by increased ET content. Silencing TuACO3 decreased ET production and compromised wheat defense to Bgt, whereas both processes were enhanced in the transgenic wheat overexpressing TuACO3. TuMYB46L, phylogenetically related to Arabidopsis MYB transcription factor AtMYB46, was found to bind to the TuACO3 promoter region in yeast-one-hybrid and EMSA experiments. TuMYB46L expression decreased rapidly following Bgt infection. Silencing TuMYB46L promoted ET content and Bgt defense, but the reverse was observed when TuMYB46L was overexpressed. Hence, decreased expression of TuMYB46L permits elevated function of TuACO3 in ET biosynthesis in Bgt-infected wheat. The TuMYB46L-TuACO3 module regulates ET biosynthesis to promote einkorn wheat defense against Bgt. Furthermore, we found four chitinase genes acting downstream of the TuMYB46L-TuACO3 module. Collectively, our data shed a new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat defense to Bgt. Article Note: These authors contributed equally to this work.

PmG3M, derived from wild emmer wheat Triticum dicoccoides accession G305-3M, is a major gene providing a wide-spectrum resistance against Bgt. PmG3M was previously mapped to wheat chromosome 6B using an F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population generated by crossing G305-3M with the susceptible T. durum wheat cultivar Langdon (LDN). In the current study, we aimed to explore the defense mechanisms conferred by PmG3M against Bgt. Histopathology of fungal development was characterized in artificially inoculated leaves of G305-3M, LDN, and homozygous RILs using fluorescence and light microscopy. G305-3M exhibited H2O2 accumulation typical of a hypersensitive response, which resulted in programmed cell death (PCD) in Bgt-penetrated epidermal cells, while LDN showed well-developed colonies without PCD. In addition, we observed a post-haustorial resistance mechanism that arrested the development of fungal feeding structures and pathogen growth in both G305-3M and resistant RIL, while LDN and a susceptible RIL displayed fully developed digitated haustoria and massive accumulation of fungal biomass. In contrast, both G305-3M and LDN exhibited callose deposition in attempt to prevent fungal invasion, supporting this as a mechanism of a basal defense response not associated with PmG3M resistance mechanism per se. The presented results shed light on the resistance mechanisms conferred by PmG3M against wheat powdery mildew.',\n"," 'Powdery mildew—caused by the fungus Erisyphe diffusa (syn. Microsphaera diffusa)—was first observed in commercial soybean crops in southern New South Wales (NSW), Australia, in 2011. Its detection raised concerns that soybean production might be constrained if the severity of the disease reached the levels observed in northern Australia. Field experiments were conducted over four consecutive seasons to examine the response of three soybean cultivars—Djakal, SnowyA and the breeding line N005A-80—to two fungicides and two fungicide application regimes. The cultivar Djakal was identified as having a high level of resistance to powdery mildew. The severity of infection symptoms varied between seasons. The most severe symptoms were observed during the 2014–2015 season which resulted in the largest grain yield reduction of 20% for the cultivar SnowyA. All fungicide treatments provided a significant reduction in the severity of symptoms, with the split application of tebuconazole and both the single and split applications of tebuconazole + prothioconazole providing the most effective control of the disease. Few other grain yield effects were found, even when strong disease control was achieved. This was a suspected result of the consistent late-in-the-season onset of the disease. Few differences were observed among the treatments in terms of lodging severity, date of physiological maturity, or grain oil and protein concentrations. It was concluded that both fungicides provided effective control of powdery mildew. However, when disease pressure is low, application might not be warranted in southern NSW.',\n"," 'Aegilops geniculata Roth has been used as a donor of disease-resistance genes, to enrich the gene pool for wheat (Triticum aestivum) improvement through distant hybridization. In this study, the wheat−Ae. geniculata alien disomic substitution line W16998 was obtained from the BC1F8 progeny of a cross between the common wheat ‘Chinese Spring’ (CS) and Ae. geniculata Roth (serial number: SY159//CS). This line was identified using cytogenetic techniques, analysis of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), functional molecular markers (Expressed sequence tag-sequence-tagged site (EST−STS) and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization−genomic in situ hybridization (sequential FISH−GISH), and assessment of agronomic traits and powdery mildew resistance. During the anaphase of meiosis, these were evenly distributed on both sides of the equatorial plate, and they exhibited high cytological stability during the meiotic metaphase and anaphase. GISH analysis indicated that W16998 contained a pair of Ae. geniculata alien chromosomes and 40 common wheat chromosomes. One EST−STS marker and seven PLUG marker results showed that the introduced chromosomes of Ae. geniculata belonged to homoeologous group 7. Nullisomic−tetrasomic analyses suggested that the common wheat chromosome, 7A, was absent in W16998. FISH and sequential FISH−GISH analyses confirmed that the introduced Ae. geniculata chromosome was 7Mg. Therefore, W16998 was a wheat−Ae. geniculata 7Mg (7A) alien disomic substitution line. Inoculation of isolate E09 (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) in the seedling stage showed that SY159 and W16998 were resistant to powdery mildew, indeed nearly immune, whereas CS was highly susceptible. Compared to CS, W16998 exhibited increased grain weight and more spikelets, and a greater number of superior agronomic traits. Consequently, W16998 was potentially useful. Germplasms transfer new disease-resistance genes and prominent agronomic traits into common wheat, giving the latter some fine properties for breeding.',\n"," 'Disease management options for organic tomato growers are limited. However, the dry winter in the Brazilian Mid-West is unfavourable to most foliar diseases, and is considered ideal for organic agriculture. We report on powdery mildew (PM) disease progress in organic tomato, under different irrigation configurations. The progress of late blight is also addressed. Staked, fresh-market tomatoes were grown in 2009 and 2010, under drip (DRP); furrow (FUR); microsprinkler (MIC); and overhead (OVH) systems. DRP, MIC and OVH were managed to maintain either high or moderate levels of soil moisture. FUR was managed to maintain moderate soil moisture only. In 2011, three treatments were added to study the extent of PM control with microsprinklers: MIC above plant canopy (MICAP); a DRP-MIC combination, above plant canopy, alternately used (DRP-MICA); and a DRP-MIC combination, where microsprinkler was applied as a PM control measure only (DRP-MICC). Irrigation systems that maximized leaf wetting provided the best PM control, reduced maximum disease severity (Ymax); severity at halfway point of the epidemic time course (Y50); area under disease progress curve (AUDPC); and disease progress rate (r). Overall, the intensity of late blight was much lower than PM, and no blight was detected in 2010. The DRP and FUR systems consistently hampered foliar diseases development in 2009/2011. PM is significantly reduced by irrigation management while late blight is a lesser disease in the Brazilian Mid-West winter season. Therefore, irrigation is a tool to control diseases in organic tomato, and likely, other cropping systems.',\n"," 'Two South African Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) strains, PPRI 7598 (non-commercial) and PPRI 7861 (commercial), were compared for virulence against the Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov). Pre-selection (21 isolates) of the most virulent strain was based on >95 % mortality of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) larvae and >90 % conidial germination.

The method breaks through the limitations of the two-dimensional spatial features extracted from RGB images when recognizing grass weeds similar to wheat. According to the species, distribution of weeds in wheat fields, we extracted the color, position, texture, and depth features of weeds in wheat fields from RGB and depth images during the tillering and jointing stages. And then used the AdaBoost algorithm for the integrated learning of multiple classifiers, thereby achieving the recognition of weeds in wheat fields. The experimental results revealed that the recognition speed of weeds during the tillering stage was 0.2 s and the accuracy rate was 88%. The recognition speed of weeds during the jointing stage was 0.69 s, and the accuracy rate of weed recognition was 81.08%. These results are significantly higher than the weed recognition rate based on features extracted from RGB images.',\n"," 'Rapid, non-destructive detection of wheat Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important tool for disease control. Red-edge (RE) is a prominent spectral feature for determining crop conditions with the potential to enhance the accuracy of monitoring FHB regionally. This study explored the potential of RE for FHB monitoring based on Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data. The novel red-edge head blight index (REHBI) was developed to detect FHB at a regional scale. Hyperspectral data at the canopy scale was integrated to simulate Sentinel-2 multispectral reflectance using the relative spectral response (RSR) function of the sensor. Then, many differential and ratio combinations of Sentinel-2 bands that were sensitive to FHB severity were selected. REHBI was established based on these basic vegetation indexes (VIs), and the model developed from REHBI performed best in monitoring FHB severity ( R2=0.82R^{2} = 0.82R2=0.82 , RMSE = 10.1). Additionally, the infected canopies with disease index (DI) values between 10 and 50 were classified as slightly diseased canopies. Ordinary least square (OLS) was used to test the performance of REHBI and two conventional VIs, i.e., OSAVI and RDVI, in monitoring slightly diseased canopies; REHBI outperformed these alternatives ( R2=0.69R^{2}= 0.69R2=0.69 , RMSE = 3.6). To approximate real agricultural conditions, Poisson noise was added to the simulated Sentinel-2 multispectral data and generalized performance of VIs was evaluated again; REHBI still had the highest R2R^{2}R2 and lowest RMSE values (0.74 and 12.6, respectively). Finally, to validate REHBI’s ability to detect FHB infection in agricultural production, it was applied to monitoring FHB in the wheat planting areas of Changfeng and Dingyuan counties from Sentinel-2 imagery. Generally, REHBI performed better in disease monitoring than OSAVI and RDVI. The overall accuracy was up to 78.6%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.51. Experimental results demonstrate that REHBI can be used to monitor FHB.',\n"," 'Wheat flour, consisting of a complex matrix of starch and protein, is used as a representative model of whole food here to investigate the binary interaction in relation to amylose level and hydrothermal treatment in noodles as a food exemplar. Noodle made of high-amylose wheat (HAW) flour showed an eight-fold higher resistant starch content, compared to the wild type. Protein removal under simulated intestinal digestion conditions resulted in higher starch digestion rate coefficients in raw and cooked flours. In cooked flours, the substrate becomes similarly accessible to digestive enzymes regardless of protein removal. The results indicate that the increased protein content in native HAW flour and thermal stability of starch in HAW noodles lead to higher food integrity and consequently enhance the resistance against α-amylase digestion. Overall, the study suggests that a diversity of starch-protein interactions in wheat-based food products underlies the nutritional value of natural whole foods.',\n"," 'BACKGROUND:Photoperiod signals provide important cues by which plants regulate their growth and development in response to predictable seasonal changes. Phytochromes, a family of red and far-red light receptors, play critical roles in regulating flowering time in response to changing photoperiods. A previous study showed that loss-of-function mutations in either PHYB or PHYC result in large delays in heading time and in the differential regulation of a large number of genes in wheat plants grown in an inductive long day (LD) photoperiod. RESULTS:We found that under non-inductive short-day (SD) photoperiods, phyB-null and phyC-null mutants were taller, had a reduced number of tillers, longer and wider leaves, and headed later than wild-type (WT) plants. The delay in heading between WT and phy mutants was greater in LD than in SD, confirming the importance of PHYB and PHYC in accelerating heading date in LDs. Both mutants flowered earlier in SD than LD, the inverse response to that of WT plants. In both SD and LD photoperiods, PHYB regulated more genes than PHYC. We identified subsets of differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes that were specifically regulated by PHYB and PHYC in either SD or LD photoperiods, and a smaller set of genes that were regulated in both photoperiods. We found that photoperiod had a contrasting effect on transcript levels of the flowering promoting genes VRN-A1 and PPD-B1 in phyB and phyC mutants compared to the WT. CONCLUSIONS:Our study confirms the major role of both PHYB and PHYC in flowering promotion in LD conditions. Transcriptome characterization revealed an unexpected reversion of the wheat LD plants into SD plants in the phyB-null and phyC-null mutants and identified flowering genes showing significant interactions between phytochromes and photoperiod that may be involved in this phenomenon. Our RNA-seq data provides insight into light signaling pathways in inductive and non-inductive photoperiods and a set of candidate genes to dissect the underlying developmental regulatory networks in wheat.',\n"," 'In this paper, we propose an original object detection methodology applied to Global Wheat Head Detection (GWHD) Dataset.

However, efforts to reduce the WF of crop production may be curtailed by the effects of climate change. This study reviewed the impacts of climate change on the WF of wheat production in Zimbabwe with the aim of identifying research gaps. Results of the review revealed limited local studies on the impacts of climate change on the WF of wheat production within Zimbabwe. Despite this, relevant global and regional studies suggest that climate change will likely result in a higher WF in Zimbabwe as well as at the global and regional level. These impacts will be due to reductions in wheat yields and increases in crop water requirements due to high temperatures, despite the CO2 fertilization effect. The implications of a higher WF of wheat production under future climate change scenarios in Zimbabwe may not be sustainable given the semi-arid status of the country. The study reviewed crop-level climate change adaptation strategies that might be implemented to lower the WF of wheat production in Zimbabwe.',\n"," 'The aggregate distortions to the incentives of South African agricultural producers have been estimated, but these measures have not been disaggregated to reveal individual agents’ incentives in a vertical value chain. In order to do this, the aggregate distortion estimates were first updated to account for the past decade, and then the wheat value chain was disaggregated for the marketing years starting in October 2000 and ending in September 2014. The results highlight how aggregate distortion estimates as developed by Anderson et al. (2006) and calculated by Kirsten, Edwards, and Vink (2009) for South African agriculture in essence mask the inter agent distortion differences in a vertical value chain. The focus in this article is on the measurement of the disaggregated distortions, while further research on the structure of the industry (its competitiveness at all levels of the value chain) and the role of the exchange rate is required to increase our understanding of the real incentives that confront these agents.',\n"," \"AGrain of Wheat (1967) is considered to be a transitional novel marking not only a thematic shift in Ngugi wa Thiong'o's oeuvre, but also a turn in his career to [...]\",\n"," 'Keywords: Immature; Mature; Scutellum; Callus induction; In vitro regeneration Abstract Hexaploid bread wheat, being highly recalcitrant, has been difficult to regenerate in vitro which limits the use of transgenesis and genome editing for its agronomic improvement and functional genomics. We have studied the comparative in vitro regeneration in six most important wheat varieties, namely, HD-2967, PBW-343, WH-1105, PBW-550, DBW-17, and WL-711, using immature vs mature scutellum. The regeneration response of varieties PBW-550, DBW-17, and HD-2967 has not yet been reported. The mature and immature scutella cultured on MS medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (2 mg l.sup.-1) or dicamba (6 mgl.sup.-1), respectively, and maltose (30 gl.sup.-1) under dark conditions developed calli which subsequently on transfer to modified MS medium with double concentration of N[H.sub.4]NO.sub.3, zeatin (5.0 mgl.sup.-1), dicamba (0.1 mgl.sup.-1), AgNO.sub.3 (2.0 mgl.sup.-1), CuSO.sub.4 (2.5 mgl.sup.-1), and sucrose (30 gl.sup.-1) under light conditions regenerated into shoots. Immature scutellum showed 100% callus induction irrespective of varieties and regenerated a maximum of 15 shoots per callus in 90% cultures, whereas mature scutellum showed a maximum 80% callus induction, producing maximum 5 shoots only in 67% cultures. Thus, immature scutellum has been more responsive comparative to mature scutellum for inducing callus and shoot regeneration. Among all the six varieties, HD-2967 was the most regenerative, which can be explored further for improving wheat via genetic transformation studies.

We introduce a reliable and inexpensive method to predict crop yields from publicly available satellite imagery. The proposed method works directly on raw satellite imagery without the need to extract any hand-crafted features or perform dimensionality reduction on the images. The approach implicitly models the relevance of the different steps in the growing season and the various bands in the satellite imagery. We evaluate the proposed approach on tehsil (block) level wheat predictions across several states in India and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods by over 50\\\\%. We also show that incorporating additional contextual information such as the location of farmlands, water bodies, and urban areas helps in improving the yield estimates.',\n"," 'Wheat is South Africa’s second most important grain crop and is produced in winter rainfall, summer rainfall, and irrigation regions. Despite being a net importer of wheat, the country has stringent wheat quality requirements as per the Agricultural Products Act (Act No. 119 of 1990). This paper investigates the effects of the quality requirements in different regions and the wheat industry as whole. Forward regression and benefit–cost analysis were applied to data on wheat area planted, seed adoption rates, prices, and cultivar performance from 1999 to 2016. A total of 31 527 observations from winter, summer and irrigation regions were used, each accounting for 4563, 8824 and 18 140 cases respectively. Forty-nine cultivars were used for trials during this period. Results show that stringent quality requirements have resulted in losses of approximately 39 000 tons from 1999 to 2016. The benefits of pursuing the prevailing quality standards amounted to R400 million while the costs amounted to R514 million, far exceeding the benefits. The resulting benefit–cost ratio was 0.78, implying that for every rand invested in breeding for quality alone, 22 cents is lost. It can be concluded that government intervention through quality standards has led to more losses than gains. In addition, investments made towards quality improvement alone have not been recovered due to the high standards. There are therefore cogent reasons to consider relaxing the quality standards to allow for higher wheat outputs, thus unlocking growth in local wheat production.',\n"," 'It is well accepted that biological innovations, particularly varietal improvements, have greatly contributed to agricultural yield and output growth in the past. At the same time, public funding for breeding programmes such as at the Agricultural Research Council in South Africa has dwindled. In an effort to confirm the importance of continued funding of varietal improvement programmes, this paper estimates the benefits from wheat varietal innovations and attributes them to the different institutional sources (public, private and others) that have contributed to varietal changes in South Africa. The empirical analyses used data on market shares of wheat varieties planted by farmers and annual quantities of wheat produced across different wheat-production areas in South Africa (summer dryland, dryland winter, and irrigation). A vintage regression model was estimated to calculate the proportional yield gain from wheat varietal improvements. The results indicated that the rate of gain in yield as a result of releases of new wheat varieties (variety research) was 0.8 per cent per year (equivalent to 19.84 kg/ha/year) for dryland summer varieties, and 0.5 per cent for both irrigation (equivalent to 32.20 kg/ha/ year) and dryland winter varieties (equivalent to 16.65 kg/ha/year). The attribution of benefits among different institutional sources confirms that not accounting for attribution of benefits by source and time period results is overestimation of benefits to any specific research programme. Attribution of benefits by institutional source showed that Sensako dominated, while the share of the ARC-SGI substantially declined, after deregulation of the wheat sub-sector. The results highlight the impact of the decline in public funding for wheat variety improvement research after deregulation and provide a strong argument for continued public funding for variety improvement in South Africa.',\n"," 'Cultivar choice is an important production decision by which producers aim to achieve highest returns with the lowest risk, for yield optimisation. Cultivar testing through evaluation trials provides information on selected cultivar characteristics and performance under different conditions, which farmers use to minimise risk elements associated with limited cultivar performance information. In South Africa, the Agricultural Research Council conducts national wheat cultivar trials funded from public resources. However, the economic value of the programme remains unknown. The study estimates aggregate economic benefits associated with the programme using data from 1998 to 2016 and attribution methodologies used in other studies, modified within the context of this study. Yield gain estimates are used as indicators to estimate the contribution of seed choice to yield growth at selected levels of the assumed plausible yield gains. Overall, the study estimates that 0.04 ton (40 kg) per hectare of extra wheat yields accrued to wheat producers as a result of cultivar trials in the period under consideration. The net present value was found to be R173 million (in 2016 prices), while South Africa received R4.33 for every Rand invested into the programme. An estimated MIRR of 7 per cent suggests that investments into the programme have been a worthwhile use of public funds. The observed yield gains and favourable efficiency measures motivate continuation of the programme.',\n"," \"Keywords: biofortification; foliar sprays; isotopes; micronutrient; phytohormones; remobilization Abstract Zinc (Zn) concentration in wheat grains is generally low, with an average value of around 28-30 mg/kg. Therefore, increasing wheat grain Zn concentration for better human health is the focus of HarvestPlus global initiatives. Source-sink interactions have been intensively studied for decades to enhance crop yield potential, but less on grain nutritional quality. This review applies concepts of source, sink, and their interactions to the study of wheat grain Zn nutrition and biofortification. Increasing Zn sources to wheat (via soil and foliar application) could directly enlarge available Zn in vegetative tissues and grain Zn sink. Rational nitrogen (N) supply increases grain Zn accumulation (N-Zn synergism), but phosphorus (P) input generally decreases (P-Zn antagonism), and the potassium (K) effect is unclear. Conventional and genetic breeding have potential to stimulate Zn flow from source to sink (uptake from soil, root-to-shoot translocation, and remobilization). However, a rational manipulation to establish a well-coordinated source-sink relationship is required to finally realize the grain Zn target (40-50 mg/kg) and increase on-farm crop yield. Future studies should focus more on fertilization modes adopted by farmers (uses of compound, slow/controlled release, and organic and microbial fertilizers) and develop integrated agronomic and genetic strategies for Zn biofortification. A highly systematic and mechanistic model includes (a) migration paths of Zn (particularly from leaves to different grain parts) using isotopic labeling methods, (b) cross-talks between Zn and carbon, N, P, K, or other divalent cations, (c) inherent physiological and biochemical processes of enzymes and signaling phytohormones, and (d) complex genetic systems governing Zn homeostasis and their relationships with other nutrients, signaling molecules, and increase or dilution/penalty of yield under different environmental conditions (soil, water, and future climatic changes) and managements (breeding and fertilization). These aspects require further elucidation to fully unravel the 'black box' of Zn flow from source to sink.

In this study, genetic variation of wheat regarding its physiological and yield responses to ozone was explored by exposing a diversity panel of 150 wheat genotypes to elevated ozone and control conditions throughout the growing season. Differential responses to ozone were observed for foliar symptom formation quantified as leaf bronzing score (LBS), vegetation indices and yield components. Vegetation indices representing the carotenoid to chlorophyll pigment ratio (such as Lic2) were particularly ozone-responsive and were thus considered suitable for the non-invasive diagnosing of ozone stress. Genetic variation in ozone-responsive traits was dissected by a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Significant marker-trait associations were identified for LBS on chromosome 5A and for vegetation indices (NDVI and Lic2) on chromosomes 6B and 6D. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in these chromosomal regions revealed distinct LD blocks containing genes with a putative function in plant redox biology such as cytochrome P450 proteins and peroxidases. This study gives novel insight into the natural genetic variation in wheat ozone response, and lays the foundation for the molecular breeding of tolerant wheat varieties.

The most sustainable way to control this disease is through planting resistant cultivars. We report the map-based cloning of the powdery mildew resistance allele Pm5e from a Chinese wheat landrace. We applied a two-step bulked segregant RNA sequencing (BSR-Seq) approach in developing tightly linked or co-segregating markers to Pm5e. The first BSR-Seq used phenotypically contrasting bulks of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) to identify Pm5e-linked markers. The second BSR-Seq utilized bulks of genetic recombinants screened from a fine-mapping population to precisely quantify the associated genomic variation in the mapping interval, and identified the Pm5e candidate genes. The function of Pm5e was validated by transgenic assay, loss-of-function mutants and haplotype association analysis. Pm5e encodes a nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) protein. A rare nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (SNV) within the C-terminal leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain is responsible for the gain of powdery mildew resistance function of Pm5e, an allele endemic to wheat landraces of Shaanxi province of China. Results from this study demonstrate the value of landraces in discovering useful genes for modern wheat breeding. The key SNV associated with powdery mildew resistance will be useful for marker-assisted selection of Pm5e in wheat breeding programs. Article Note: These authors contributed equally to this work.

Loss of resistance in cultivars prompts a continuing search for new sources of resistance. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, WEW), the progenitor of both modern tetraploid and hexaploid wheats, harbors many powdery mildew resistance genes. We report here the positional cloning and functional characterization of Pm41, a powdery mildew resistance gene derived from WEW, which encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat protein (CNL). Mutagenesis and stable genetic transformation confirmed the function of Pm41 against Bgt infection in wheat. We demonstrated that Pm41 was present at a very low frequency (1.81%) only in southern WEW populations. It was absent in other WEW populations, domesticated emmer, durum, and common wheat, suggesting that the ancestral Pm41 was restricted to its place of origin and was not incorporated into domesticated wheat. Our findings emphasize the importance of conservation and exploitation of the primary WEW gene pool, as a valuable resource for discovery of resistance genes for improvement of modern wheat cultivars.

There are nine NPR1 homologues (TaNPR1) in wheat, but little research has been done to understand the function of those NPR1-like genes in the wheat defence response against stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) pathogens. We used bioinformatics and reverse genetics approaches to study the expression and function of each TaNPR1. We found six members of TaNPR1 located on homoeologous group 3 chromosomes (designated as TaG3NPR1) and three on homoeologous group 7 chromosomes (designated as TaG7NPR1). The group 3 NPR1 proteins regulate transcription of SA-responsive PR genes. Downregulation of all the TaNPR1 homologues via virus-induced gene co-silencing resulted in enhanced resistance to stem rust. More specifically downregulating TaG7NPR1 homeologues or Ta7ANPR1 expression resulted in stem rust resistance phenotype. By contrast, knocking down TaG3NPR1 alone did not show visible phenotypic changes in response to the rust pathogen. Knocking out Ta7ANPR1 enhanced resistance to stem rust. The Ta7ANPR1 locus is alternatively spliced under pathogen inoculated conditions. We discovered a new mode of NPR1 action in wheat at the Ta7ANPR1 locus through an NB-ARC-NPR1 fusion protein negatively regulating the defence to stem rust infection.

One option is to control the formation and repair of the meiosis-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination between the homologous chromosomes and ultimately lead to crossovers. These DSBs are introduced by the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein SPO11 and associated proteins. Here, we characterized the homoeologous copies of the SPO11-1 protein in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). The genome contains three SPO11-1 gene copies that exhibit 93-95% identity at the nucleotide level, and clearly the A and D copies originated from the diploid ancestors Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii, respectively. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of 105 plant genomes revealed a clear partitioning between monocots and dicots, with the seven main motifs being almost fully conserved, even between clades. The functional similarity of the proteins among monocots was confirmed through complementation analysis of the Oryza sativa (rice) spo11-1 mutant by the wheat TaSPO11-1-5D coding sequence. Also, remarkably, although the wheat and Arabidopsis SPO11-1 proteins share only 55% identity and the partner proteins also differ, the TaSPO11-1-5D cDNA significantly restored the fertility of the Arabidopsis spo11-1 mutant, indicating a robust functional conservation of the SPO11-1 protein activity across distant plants. These successful heterologous complementation assays, using both Arabidopsis and rice hosts, are good surrogates to validate the functionality of candidate genes and cDNA, as well as variant constructs, when the transformation and mutant production in wheat is much longer and more tedious.

La adaptación de la fecha de floración a cada ambiente en particular forma parte de un mecanismo de escape al estrés, lo que podría reducir el impacto negativo esperado debido al cambio climático. La hipótesis general sobre la que se establece este estudio es que un cambio en la fecha de floración afectaría a las condiciones ambientales durante las fases críticas del desarrollo del trigo, lo que a su vez puede tener un impacto en la formación del rendimiento. Un conjunto de líneas de trigo duro de primavera, con variaciones alélicas contrastantes para loci Ppd-1, que afectan la sensibilidad al fotoperiodo, fueron ensayadas en un amplio rango de latitudes del hemisferio Norte (41°N en España, 27°N en el noroeste de México, y 19°N en el sur de México, esta última con siembra de primavera). Se llevaron a cabo experimentos de campo en regadío, entre los años 2007 y 2012, para investigar el efecto que tuvieron las variantes alélicas en los loci Ppd-A1 y Ppd-B1 sobre la fenología y la formación del rendimiento. Los genotipos con el alelo Ppd-A1a GS100, causante de insensibilidad al fotoperiodo, tendieron a presentar un peso de grano (PG) y un rendimiento superiores al resto. Las variantes alélicas para Ppd-B1 no afectaron a la fecha de floración, pero el alelo causante de insensibilidad al fotoperiodo (Ppd B1b) aumentó el número de granos por unidad de superficie (NG) debido a un aumento de número de espiguillas espiga-1. Una floración más temprana (ya fuera debida a Ppd-1 o a precocidad intrínseca, Eps) tendió a estar asociada con rendimiento más alto debido a un PG mayor. Las combinaciones alélicas GS105/Ppd-B1b y Ppd-A1b/Ppd-B1b se asociaron con un incremento de NG debido a un aumento del número de granos espiguilla-1, pero esto no se tradujo en un mayor rendimiento debido a la relación negativa entre NG y PG. Una floración más temprana producida por genes Eps tuvo como resultado un menor número de espiguillas espiga-1, pero no un menor NG. Cuando ambos alelos en los loci Ppd-1 poseían el mismo tipo de respuesta al fotoperiodo (sensible/sensible o insensible/insensible) se observó una mayor estabilidad en el rendimiento. Las condiciones ambientales durante la primera mitad del periodo de llenado de grano fueron los factores más importantes para definir el PG. Un retraso en la fecha de floración se asoció con reducciones en la tasa de llenado de grano y el PG. En las latitudes donde la siembra se realizó en otoño, un incremento de 1°C en la temperatura media redujo el PG en 5,2 mg grano-1. El análisis de asociación de fenotipo-genotipo mostró que las regiones en los cromosomas 6A (114 cM) y 6B (126 cM) se asociaron en general con el rendimiento, representando regiones críticas con QTLs importantes.

Here we used an independent RNA-Seq dataset to test the predictions of the wheat GENIE3 network for the senescence-regulating transcription factor NAM-A1 (TraesCS6A02G108300). We re-analyzed the RNA-Seq data against the RefSeqv1.0 genome and identified a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the wild-type and nam-a1 mutant which recapitulated the known role of NAM-A1 in senescence and nutrient remobilisation. We found that the GENIE3-predicted target genes of NAM-A1 overlap significantly with the DEGs, more than would be expected by chance. Based on high levels of overlap between GENIE3-predicted target genes and the DEGs, we identified candidate senescence regulators. We then explored genome-wide trends in the network related to polyploidy and found that only homeologous transcription factors are likely to share predicted targets in common. However, homeologs which vary in expression levels across tissues are less likely to share predicted targets than those that do not, suggesting that they may be more likely to act in distinct pathways. This work demonstrates that the wheat GENIE3 network can provide biologically-relevant predictions of transcription factor targets, which can be used for candidate gene prediction and for global analyses of transcription factor function. The GENIE3 network has now been integrated into the KnetMiner web application, facilitating its use in future studies.',\n"," 'Torpong Thongngarm, 1 Chamard Wongsa, 1 Punchama Pacharn, 2 Surapon Piboonpocanun, 3 Mongkhon Sompornrattanaphan 1 1Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; 2Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand; 3Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Salaya, Nakhonpathom, ThailandCorrespondence: Mongkhon SompornrattanaphanDivision of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, ThailandTel/Fax +66 2419 8263Email mongkhon.som@mahidol.ac.thBackground: IgE-mediated wheat allergy in adults can be childhood or adulthood onset. Adult-onset wheat allergy has been reported, but data on clinical characteristics and practical food challenge protocols are scarce.Objective: We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of adult-onset wheat allergy, laboratory results, and outcomes of a modified 3-day challenge protocol using a combination of aspirin, wheat, and exercise.Patients and Methods: Patients with histories compatible with adult-onset wheat allergy were recruited from Siriraj Hospital, Thailand. Clinical history, skin prick tests (SPTs), and specific IgE (sIgE) levels were ascertained. Patients with no food challenge contraindications were asked to volunteer for wheat challenge. A modified 3-day protocol using 300 mg of acetylsalicylic acid, 60– 75 g of wheat flour, and exercise was used for confirmatory diagnosis of conventional wheat allergy (WA) and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA).Results: Thirty-three patients were recruited. The mean age of onset was 29.7 years (SD 10.5). SPTs yielded positivity rates of 9.1%, 84.8%, and 81.8% in commercial wheat, in-house gliadin, and in-house glutenin extracts, respectively. sIgE yielded a positivity rate of 61% and 88% in wheat and ω 5-gliadin, respectively. Eighteen patients underwent oral wheat challenges. Of these, 17 patients (94.4%) had positive challenges leading to definite diagnoses of WA (35%), and WDEIA (65%). One WDEIA patient developed hypotensive anaphylaxis in the protocol.Conclusion: WDEIA was the most common phenotype. Our modified 3-day protocol could differentiate WA and WDEIA and yielded a high positivity rate (94.4%). It should be used cautiously as severe reactions can occur.Keywords: anaphylaxis, food allergy, food challenge, wheat allergy, gliadin, lipid transfer protein',\n"," 'The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation on the quality of einkorn wheat straw (EWS) and in vitro gas production (GP). It was found that AM inoculation of EW seed before sowing caused significant increases in crude protein (CP), ether extract (EE), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) levels of straw, and a (P <0.05) decrease in crude ash (CA), metabolizable energy (ME), and organic matter digestibility (OMD) compared with the straw of non-inoculated EW. The observed difference in the average GP among the between EWS from plants grown from inoculated seed and those from the untreated control was significant at all times between the third and 96th hour. However, when the GP kinetics of the groups was examined after 96 hours’ incubation, only the difference in the gas amount of the easily soluble fractions of feeds was significant. The GP from the slowly fermented part, the GP rate constant and the potential GP of the straws were not affected by the AM inoculation (P >0.05). Thus, inoculation of einkorn wheat with AM altered the nutritional value of the straw produced creating a roughage with decreased value for feeding ruminant livestock.',\n"," 'South Africa currently faces a wheat production crisis, suggesting that current policies, research and development projects may not be well aligned to farmer priorities. Through exploratory research, which included field inspections and farmer and researcher interviews, we identified the major constraints to irrigation wheat yield and explored opportunities for improving the yield and farmer profits. The dominant constraint to yield was identified as the low market price for grain, which makes farmers reluctant to invest in inputs for increasing wheat yield. Poor cultivar choice, cereal-based monocropping, the high cost of irrigation, inadequate irrigation water, low crop stands, soil acidity, no-till practices and red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea) birds are negatively impacting yields. Most importantly, we highlight a misalignment between current research efforts and farmer priorities. Recommendations for corrective measures necessary to improve yield and farmer profits are provided. This new knowledge will be useful to policymakers and researchers for better orienting investments in research and development projects aimed at addressing the current wheat production crisis in the country.Significance:• We highlight a misalignment between current research efforts and farmer priorities in the wheat sector, and provide new knowledge for better orienting investments in research and development projects aimed at addressing the current wheat production crisis.',\n"," 'Keywords: drought; genetic diversity; grain size and number; resilience; wheat; yield potential Abstract Pressures of population growth and climate change require the development of resilient higher yielding crops, particularly to drought. A spring wheat diversity panel was developed to combine high-yield potential with resilience. To assess performance under drought, which in many environments is intermittent and dependent on plant development, 150 lines were grown with drought imposed for 10 days either at jointing or at anthesis stages in Obregon, Mexico. Both drought treatments strongly reduced grain numbers compared with the fully irrigated check. Best performers under drought at jointing had more grain than poor performers, while best performers under drought at anthesis had larger grain than poor performers. Most high-yielding lines were high yielding in one drought environment only. However, some of the best-performing lines displayed yield potential and resilience across two environments (28 lines), particularly for yield under well-watered and drought at jointing, where yield was most related to grain numbers. Strikingly, only three lines were high yielding across all three environments, and interestingly, these lines had high grain numbers. Among parameters measured in leaves and grain, leaf relative water content did not correlate with yield, and proline was negatively correlated with yield; there were small but significant relationships between leaf sugars and yield. This study provides a valuable resource for further crosses and for elucidating genes and mechanisms that may contribute to grain number and grain filling conservation to combine yield potential and drought resilience.

Paul',\n"," \"Keywords: climate change; climatic factor interactions; crop modelling; elevated CO.sub.2; Gladius; Paragon; temperature; water availability Abstract Climate change predictions foresee a combination of rising CO.sub.2, temperature and altered precipitation. Effects of single climatic variables are well defined, but the importance of combined variables and genotypic effects is less known, although pivotal for assessing climate change impacts, for example, with crop growth models. This study provides developmental and physiological data from combined climatic factors for two distinct wheat cultivars (Paragon and Gladius), as a basis to improve predictions for climate change scenarios. The two cultivars were grown in controlled climate chambers in a fully factorial setup of atmospheric CO.sub.2 concentration, growth temperature and watering regime. The cultivars differed considerably in their developmental rate, response pattern and the parameters responsible for most of their variation. The growth of Paragon was linked to climatic effects on photosynthesis and mainly affected by temperature. Paragon was overall more negatively affected by all treatment combinations compared to Gladius. Gladius was mostly affected by watering regime. The cultivars' acclimation strategies to climate factors varied significantly. Thus, considering a single factor is an oversimplification very likely impacting the accuracy of crop growth models. Intraspecific crop variation could help understanding genotype by environment variation. Cultivars with high phenotypic plasticity may have greater resilience against climatic variability.

Therefore, TaALMT1 may facilitate acidification of an alkaline rhizosphere by promoting exudation of both malate and GABA. Here, the performance of wheat near isogenic lines ET8 (Al.sup.+3-tolerant, high TaALMT1 expression) and ES8 (Al.sup.+3-sensitive, low TaALMT1 expression) are compared. Root growth (at 5weeks) was higher for ET8 than ES8 at pH 9. ET8 roots exuded more malate and GABA at high pH and acidified the rhizosphere more rapidly. GABA and malate exudation was enhanced at high pH by the addition of aluminate in both ET8 and transgenic barley expressing TaALMT1. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TaALMT1 acidified an alkaline media more rapidly than controls corresponding to higher GABA efflux. TaALMT1 expression did not change under alkaline conditions but key genes involved in GABA turnover changed in accordance with a high rate of GABA synthesis. We propose that TaALMT1 plays a role in alkaline tolerance by exuding malate and GABA, possibly coupled to proton efflux.

Here, we use a targeted mutagenesis approach based on the natural diversity of the Pm3 powdery mildew resistance alleles present in different wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes. In order to understand the functional importance of the amino acid polymorphisms between the active immune receptor PM3A and the inactive ancestral variant PM3CS, we exchanged polymorphic regions and residues in the LRR domain of PM3A with the corresponding segments of PM3CS. These novel variants were functionally tested for recognition of the corresponding AVRPM3.sup.A2/F2 avirulence protein in Nicotiana benthamiana. We identified polymorphic residues in four regions of PM3A that enhance the immune response, but also residues that reduce it or result in complete loss of function. We found that the identified critical residues in PM3A modify its activation threshold towards different protein variants of AVRPM3.sup.A2/F2. PM3A variants with a lowered threshold gave a stronger overall response and gained an extended recognition spectrum. One of these variant proteins with a single amino acid change was stably transformed into wheat, where it conferred race-specific resistance to mildew. This is a proof of concept that improved PM3A variants with an enlarged recognition spectrum can be engineered based on natural diversity by exchanging single or multiple residues that modulate resistance function.

This involves a protein complex that includes in plants the two similar proteins, SPO11-1 and SPO11-2. We analysed the sequences of SPO11-2 in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), as well as in its diploid and tetraploid progenitors. We investigated its role during meiosis using single, double and triple mutants. The three homoeologous SPO11-2 copies of hexaploid wheat exhibit high nucleotide and amino acid similarities with those of the diploids, tetraploids and Arabidopsis. Interestingly, however, two nucleotides deleted in exon-2 of the A copy lead to a premature stop codon and suggest that it encodes a non-functional protein. Remarkably, the mutation was absent from the diploid A-relative Triticum urartu, but present in the tetraploid Triticum dicoccoides and in different wheat cultivars indicating that the mutation occurred after the first polyploidy event and has since been conserved. We further show that triple mutants with all three copies (A, B, D) inactivated are sterile. Cytological analyses of these mutants show synapsis defects, accompanied by severe reductions in bivalent formation and numbers of DMC1 foci, thus confirming the essential role of TaSPO11-2 in meiotic recombination in wheat. In accordance with its 2-nucleotide deletion in exon-2, double mutants for which only the A copy remained are also sterile. Notwithstanding, some DMC1 foci remain visible in this mutant, suggesting a residual activity of the A copy, albeit not sufficient to restore fertility. CAPTION(S): Figure S1.

The aim of this work was to study the chemical profile of the EO from laurel (Laurus nobilis) and its antifungal, antitoxigenic, and antioxidant activities. The extractive yield of the EO from Algerian laurel was 1.13% being 1,8-cineole the most dominant compound (35.5%) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The values of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) against Aspergillus flavus were 1.75 and 2 mg/ml, respectively. The production of aflatoxin B1 was inhibited by EO concentrations between 0.25 mg/ml (15% decrease) and 1.50 mg/ml (86% decrease), and it was totally inhibited at the MFC value. The EO showed a wide antifungal spectrum against other species in a dose-dependent manner. In a food-model study, the L. nobilis EO showed remarkable efficacy in fumigated wheat grains, providing from 51.5% to 76.7% protection against A. flavus during 6-month storage. The L. nobilis EO showed good free radical scavenging activity by DPPH assay (IC.sub.50 value of 602 [MU]g/ml) and moderate antioxidant activity in the [beta]-carotene bleaching assay (46% inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation). The conclusions of this study justify future research for the application of EO from laurel as a natural preservative to improve food safety and extend shelf life by controlling spoilage and toxigenic molds as well as oxidative damage.

A naturally occurring single nucleotide substitution was identified in the gene encoding a major Na.sup.+ transporter TaHKT1;5-D in Mocho de Espiga Branca, which resulted in a L190P amino acid residue variation.

WTK2 was identified by map-based cloning and validated by transformation of a c.10-kb genomic sequence including WTK2 into susceptible common wheat variety Fielder (Triticum aestivum L.). Transformation of Fielder with WTK2 was sufficient to confer Pgt resistance. Sr60 transcripts were transiently upregulated 1 d post-inoculation with Pgt, but not in mock-inoculated plants. The upregulation of Sr60 was associated with stable upregulation of several pathogenesis-related genes. The Sr60-resistant haplotype found in T. monococcum was not found in polyploid wheat, suggesting an opportunity to introduce a novel resistance gene. Sr60 was successfully introgressed into hexaploid wheat, and we developed a diagnostic molecular marker to accelerate its deployment and pyramiding with other resistance genes. The cloned Sr60 also can be a useful component of transgenic cassettes including other resistance genes with complementary resistance profiles.',\n"," 'Accurate counting of wheat ears in field conditions is vital to predict yield and for crop breeding. To quickly and accurately obtain the number of wheat ears in a field, we propose herein a method to count wheat ears based on fully convolutional network (FCN) and Harris corner detection. The technical procedure consists essentially of 1) constructing a dataset of wheat-ear images from acquired red-green-blue (RGB) images; 2) training a FCN as the wheat-ear segmentation model by using the constructed image dataset; 3) preparing testing images and inputting them into the segmentation model to get the initial segmentation results; 4) binarizing the initial segmentation by using the Otsu algorithm (to facilitate subsequent processing); and 5) applying Harris corner detection after extracting the wheat-ear skeleton to obtain the number of wheat ears in the images. The segmentation results show that the proposed FCN-based segmentation model segments wheat ears with an average accuracy of 0.984 and at low computational cost. An average of only 0.033 s is required to segment a 256× 256 -pixel wheat-ear image. Moreover, the segmentation result is improved by nearly 10% compared with the previous segmentation methods under conditions of wheat-ear occlusion, leaf occlusion, uneven illumination, and soil disturbance. Subsequently, the proposed counting method achieves good results, with an average accuracy of 0.974, a coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of 0.983, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.043. These metrics are all improved by 10% compared with the previous methods. These results show that the proposed method accurately counts wheat ears even under conditions of wheat-ear adhesion. Furthermore, the results provide an important technique for studying wheat phenotyping.',\n"," '@@@@Highlights •Typical Sponge and Dough fermentation times produce sufficient ethanol and succinic acid to impact dough rheology.•Succinic acid and ethanol have a synergistic effect in dough mixing.•Succinic acid causes increase in peak mixing resistance of durum wheat flour.•Gliadin and LMW Glutenin appear to be adding to peak mixing resistance and dough stability.',\n"," 'Highlights •Conventional flour had 4-time higher pesticide residues than organic flour.•Conventional whole-grain flour had 2-time higher pesticide residues than white flour.•Organic whole-grain and white flours had similarly low pesticide residue levels.•Common wheat had 2-times higher pesticide residues that Spelt wheat flour.',\n"," '@@@@Highlights •The GlutoPeak whole wheat flour peak maximum time between 30.0-50.0 s and the torque before maximum between 15.0-20.0 GPU were found suitable for soft-dough and 40.0-60.0 s and 20.0-23.0 GPU for hard-dough biscuit products.•The genotypes had torque before maximum > 24.0 GPU and peak maximum time > 60.0 s sould be eliminated.•The agregation energy and torque after maximum can be used only for selecting soft-dough groups.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Triticum kiharae (AtAtGGDD, 2n = 42) is of interest for the improvement of bread wheat as a source of high grain protein and gluten content, as well as resistance to many diseases. The use of T. kiharae for the improvement of T. aestivum L. is complicated by the fact that the homology degree of their genomes is low and this leads to an unbalanced set of chromosomes in the gametes of its first generations and the elimination of some genotypes. The aim of this study was to analyze the nature of alien introgressions and their effect on the cytological stability of hybrids obtained from crossing of bread wheat varieties with T. kiharae. Results Using C-banding, the presence of entire chromosomes of T. kiharae in the karyotypes of hybrid lines (intergenomic substitution 2G/2B), chromosome arms (centric translocation Т2AtS:2AL) and large inserts in the form of terminal translocations involving chromosomes of 1st, 3rd and 5th homoeologous groups of B- and G-genomes were found. Molecular markers revealed short introgression of T. kiharae into the genome of common wheat varieties. The highest introgression frequency was shown for 1A, 1B, 2A, 5B, and 6A chromosomes, while no foreign chromatin was detected in 4A and 4B chromosomes. A high level of cytological stability (a meiotic index of 88.18–93.0%) was noted for the majority of introgression lines. An exception was found for the lines containing the structural reorganization of chromosome 5B, affecting the main genes of chromosome synapsis in terms of their functioning. Conclusions During the stabilization of hybrid karyotypes, the introgression of genetic material from T. kiharae into the genome of T. aestivum occurs in the form of short fragments detectable only by molecular markers and in the form of whole chromosomes (intergenomic substitution) and their large fragments (centric and terminal translocations). The level of cytological stability achieved in F10 by the majority of introgression lines ensures the formation of functional gametes sufficient for the successful reproduction of the obtained hybrids.',\n"," 'A collection of soft winter wheat specimens investigated on the artificial infectious background of the leaf rust pathogen and selected resistance among them.

Mannan structure and properties vary according to species and organ. The cell walls of cereal grains have been extensively studied due to their role in cereal processing and to their beneficial effect on human health as dietary fiber. Recently, we showed that mannan in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain endosperm has a linear structure of β-1,4-linked mannose residues. The aim of this work was to study the biosynthesis and function of wheat grain mannan. We showed that mannan is deposited in the endosperm early during grain development, and we identified candidate mannan biosynthetic genes expressed in the endosperm. The functional study in wheat was unsuccessful therefore our best candidate genes were expressed in heterologous systems. The endosperm-specificTaCslA12 gene expressed in Pichia pastoris and in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant depleted in glucomannan led to the production of wheat-like linear mannan lacking glucose residues and with moderate acetylation. Therefore, this gene encodes a mannan synthase and is likely responsible for the synthesis of wheat endosperm mannan.',\n"," 'Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are the most abundant type of immune receptors in plants and can trigger a rapid cell-death (hypersensitive) response upon sensing pathogens. We previously cloned the wheat NLR Sr35, which encodes a coiled-coil (CC) NLR that confers resistance to the virulent wheat stem rust race Ug99. Here, we investigated Sr35 signaling after Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. Expression of Sr35 in N. benthamiana leaves triggered a mild cell-death response, which is enhanced in the autoactive mutant Sr35 D503V. The N-terminal tagging of Sr35 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) blocked the induction of cell death, whereas a C-terminal GFP tag did not. No domain truncations of Sr35 generated cell-death responses as strong as the wild type, but a truncation including the NB-ARC (nucleotide binding adaptor) shared by APAF-1, R proteins, and CED-4 domains in combination with the D503V autoactive mutation triggered cell death. In addition, coexpression of Sr35 with the matching pathogen effector protein AvrSr35 resulted in robust cell death and electrolyte leakage levels that were similar to autoactive Sr35 and significantly higher than Sr35 alone. Coexpression of Sr35-CC-NB-ARC and AvrSr35 did not induce cell death, confirming the importance of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain for AvrSr35 recognition. These findings were confirmed through Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in barley. Taken together, these results implicate the CC-NB-ARC domains of Sr35 in inducing cell death and the LRR domain in AvrSr35 recognition.[Formula: see text] Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).

Drought is a major abiotic stress that can restrict plants growth and yields, thus the identification of genotypes with higher adaptability to drought stress represents one of the primary goals in breeding programs. During abiotic stress, metabolic adaptation is crucial for stress tolerance, and accumulation of specific amino acids and/or as secondary metabolites deriving from amino acid metabolism may correlate with the increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. This work, focused on the metabolism of branched chain-amino acids (BCAAs) in durum wheat and the role of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases (BCATs) in stress response. The role of BCATs in plant response to drought was previously proposed for Arabidopsis, where the levels of BCAAs were altered at the transcriptional level under drought conditions, triggering the onset of defense response metabolism. However, in wheat the role of BCAAs as a trigger of the onset of the drought defense response has not been elucidated. A comparative genomic approach elucidated the composition of the BCAT gene family in durum wheat. Here we demonstrate a tissue and developmental stage specificity of BCATs regulation in the drought response. Moreover, a metabolites profiling was performed on two contrasting durum wheat cultivars Colosseo and Cappelli resulting in the detection of a specific pattern of metabolites accumulated among genotypes and, in particular, in an enhanced BCAAs accumulation in the tolerant cv Cappelli further supporting a role of BCAAs in the drought defense response. The results support the use of gene expression and target metabolomic in modern breeding to shape new cultivars more resilient to a changing climate.',\n"," 'Impurities in wheat seriously affect wheat quality and food security. They are mainly produced during the operational process of combine harvesters. To solve the recognition and classification problems associated with impurities in wheat, a recognition method using an improved convolutional neural network is proposed in this article. A labeled dataset of normal wheat and five impurities is constructed, using which the Wiener filtering algorithm and the multi-scale Retinex enhancement algorithm are employed for image preprocessing. Based on network research using Inception_v3, improvement and optimization are undertaken before designing the WheNet convolutional neural network, which is intended for automatic recognition of wheat images. Under the same conditions, comparative experiments using the WheNet, ResNet_101 and Inception_v3 networks are conducted. Indexes such as receiver operating characteristic, area under curve (AUC), and recall rate are adopted to evaluate the experimental outcomes. Experimental results indicate that the WheNet network achieved the most efficient results. It also shows a shorter training time, and its recognition accuracies for Top_1 and Top_5 of the test set are 98.59% and 99.98%, respectively. The mean values of both the AUC and recall rate of the network on the recognition of various images of impurities are higher than those of the ResNet_101 and Inception_v3 networks. Consequently, the WheNet network can be a useful tool in recognizing impurities in wheat. Furthermore, this method can be used to detect impurities in other fields.',\n"," 'Wheat stripe rust, due to infection by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease that causes significant global grain yield losses. Yr36, which encodes Wheat Kinase START1 (WKS1), is an effective high-temperature adult-plant resistance gene and confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races. We previously showed that WKS1 phosphorylates the thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase protein and reduces its ability to detoxify peroxides, which may contribute to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). WKS1-mediated Pst resistance is accompanied by leaf chlorosis in Pst-infected regions, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that WKS1 interacts with and phosphorylates PsbO, an extrinsic member of photosystem II (PSII), to reduce photosynthesis, regulate leaf chlorosis, and confer Pst resistance. A point mutation in PsbO-A1 or reduction in its transcript levels by RNA interference resulted in chlorosis and reduced Pst sporulation. Biochemical analyses revealed that WKS1 phosphorylates PsbO at two conserved amino acids involved in physical interactions with PSII and reduces the binding affinity of PsbO with PSII. Presumably, phosphorylated PsbO proteins dissociate from the PSII complex and then undergo rapid degradation by cysteine and aspartic proteases. Taken together, these results demonstrate that perturbations of wheat PsbO by point mutation or phosphorylation by WKS1 reduce the rate of photosynthesis and delay the growth of Pst pathogen before the induction of ROS.',\n"," 'Abstract Background MYB superfamily is one of the most abundant families in plants, which plays important roles in plant growth, development, and productivity. However, to date, researches on MYBs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are scattered mostly, not comprehensive. Results In this study, a total of 393 R2R3-MYBs and 12 R1R2R3-MYBs were identified and analyzed including gene structure, chromosomal distribution, synteny relationship, and evolutionary relationship. Then, 29 clusters tandem duplication and 8 clusters segmental duplication genes were discovered. The expression profile of the identified genes under abiotic and biotic stress was analyzed using RNA-seq data. Based on expression patterns analysis, we screened many candidate genes involved in plant response to abiotic and biotic stress. Among them, the functional characteristics of TaMYB344 were further studied. TaMYB344 was localized in the nucleus and functioned as a weak transcriptional activator. We demonstrated that TaMYB344-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants had enhanced tolerance to drought, heat, and high salt stress. Conclusions In this study, 393 R2R3-MYBs and 12 R1R2R3-MYBs in wheat were systemically identified and analyzed. Differential expression analysis indicated that many R2R3-MYBs were involved in abiotic and biotic stress response. We identified a potential candidate gene TaMYB344, overexpression of which in tobacco plants enhanced drought, heat, and salt stress tolerance. These results will provide abundant molecular data for breeding new varieties of wheat in the future.',\n"," 'Abstract NPR1 is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in plant species. In our previous study, we identified a conserved fungal effector PNPi from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) that can suppress acquired resistance in local leaf by directly targeting the wheat NPR1 protein. In this investigation, we identified and validated a novel protein interaction between PNPi and wheat pathogenesis-related TaPR1a in the apoplastic space. TaPR1a-overexpressing wheat lines exhibited enhanced resistance to both Pst and Puccinia triticina (Pt). We further determined that exogenous expression of PNPi RNA in transgenic wheat lines reduced the degree of acquired resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae isolate P131 in the region adjacent to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 infection area. Additionally, when PNPi was overexpressed, the expression levels of two plant defense responsive genes were suppressed upon P. syringae DC3000 infection in the local infiltration region. These findings established the mechanism of a single rust effector that can suppress multiple defense responses in wheat plants by targeting different components.',\n"," 'There is a difference in the selling price for cassava, taro, and wheat flour, with taro flour having a higher price. It could be a reason for adulterating the taro flour from the other two flours and reducing quality. This study aims to distinguish the three types of flour using the near-infrared (NIR) spectra combined with chemometrics. The NIR spectra of all samples were measured at a wavelength of 1000-2500 nm. The multivariate analysis used was principal component analysis (PCA), and PCA followed with discriminant analysis (DA). The preliminary process of the signal using area normalization was carried out before the multivariate analysis. The PCA results showed that most of the samples were grouped in their respective groups except for two samples, namely 1 sample of taro flour and 1 sample of cassava flour. Meanwhile, the PCA-DA results using seven main components showed that the three samples were grouped well. DA validation was carried out using the cross-validation method, showing that the samples could be identified into their respective groups. Therefore, a combination of NIR spectrum and chemometric analysis can be used to differentiate cassava, taro, and wheat flour',\n"," 'The development of a complex bakery improver \"Freshness CDP SUPER\" (Ukraine) to slow down the staling of products developed for accelerated technologies is urgent. It contains nutritional supplements with GRAS status. Whey protein concentrate \"CDP-UV-65\" was chosen as a functional basis. The active part contains the enzyme preparation Novamil 1500MG, maltodextrin, defatted sunflower lecithin, carboxymethyl cellulose, apple pectin, dry wheat gluten and ascorbic acid. It is proved that with rational dosage of the developed complex bakery improver in the amount of 1.5% to the flour mass, the bread production process is reduced by 180 minutes. It has been established that the bread \"Milk Freshness\", the recipe of which includes the developed improver, is characterized by a higher specific volume by 10.1% in comparison with the control, porosity, and better shape stability of hearth products. It has been proven that products with the addition of the Freshness CDP SUPER complex bakery improver retain freshness longer, which is confirmed by a 47% greater total crumb deformation compared to the control. The inhibition of staling in bread \"Milk Freshness\" occurs due to the accumulation of dextrin by 27.1% compared with the control. Thus, the total content of dextrins in wheat bread is 1.918% to DS, and in Milk Freshness bread - 2.438% to DS. The research results prove the expediency of using the complex bakery improver \"Freshness CDP SUPER\" in the technology of wheat bread in order to extend the preservation period of its freshness up to 72 hours in unpackaged form',\n"," 'Purpose. To determine the effectiveness of using contrasting sowing dates after different predecessors to assess the genotypes of bread winter wheat in terms of yield and stability. Methods. Field, laboratory, mathematical statistics. Results. A different, but reliable level of influence on the yield of bread winter wheat genotypes of such factors as conditions of the year of cultivation (66.2%), predecessors (12.5%), sowing date (6.1%) and genotype (1.7% ) was revealed. Significant differences were noted in the response of the studied genotypes to the sowing date after different predecessors. Relatively less influence of the predecessors on the yield of the varieties ‘Estafeta Myronivska’ and ‘Vezha Myronivska’ was revealed, more – for the varieties ‘MIP Darunok’, ‘MIP Kniazhna’ and ‘MIP Vyshyvanka’. The sowing dates had less influence on the yield of the varieties ‘MIP Fortuna’, ‘MIP Vyshyvanka’ and ‘Trudivnytsia Myronivska’. A general tendency for decrease in the average annual yield was established in the experiment with a shift in the sowing dates from September 26 to October 16. However, for the number of genotypes after certain predecessors, the optimal sowing date was the 5th of October: after the predecessor, green-manure fallow – for varieties ‘Trudivnytsia myronivska’, ‘MIP Assol’ and ‘MIP Dniprianka’, after mustard – ‘Vezha Myronivska’, after sunflower – ‘MIP Fortuna’, after corn – ‘MIP Fortuna’ and ‘Podolianka’. In terms of sowing dates, the least variation in yield was found after the predecessors green manure, mustard and corn varieties ‘MIP Vyshyvanka’, ‘Balada Myronivska’, ‘MIP Kniazhna’, ‘Estafeta Myronivska’. Using the GGE biplot, it was found that close to the ‘ideal environment’ for the realization of the yield level of most genotypes was the second sowing date after greenmanure fallow predecessor. For different sowing dates and predecessors, on average for three years, the optimal combination of the level of yield and stability was noted for the varieties ‘Trudivnytsia Myronivska’, ‘MIP Vidznaka’, ‘MIP Assol’, ‘Estafeta Myronivska’, ‘MIP Valensiia’. Conclusions. Thus, the use of different so wing dates after various predecessors is an effective approach to organization of genotype-environmental tests. It makes it possible to identify the genotypes which are specifically adapted to certain conditions (predecessors and sowing dates) and genotypes with a relatively high level of stability when sowing after various predecessors and on different dates. This approach can be used both at the final stage of breeding to differentiate breeding lines for yield and stability, and in the development of basic elements of technology for growing newly created varieties.',\n"," 'This work was conducted as a pot experiment, to evaluate the effect of adding K, Fe, Zn, and Mn with conventional fertilizers on K/Na, Ca/Na and Mg/Na ratios and Catalase enzyme activity in leaves and on growth and yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under salinity conditions. K was added solely with conventional fertilizer dose (F1). In the second treatment, K, Fe, Zn, and Mn were sprayed on the plant as a foliar application before heading stage (F2). In the third treatment, K, Fe, Zn, and Mn were applied to the soil with conventional fertilizer dose (F3). Control treatment (F0), at which only conventional fertilizer dose was applied, for comparison. The field was irrigated with saline groundwater of 4.30 dS m-1.

Grain yield was increased by 29.60%, 31.52%, and 27.46% under F1, F2, and F3 treatments compared to that of control, respectively. Catalase activity under (F1) treatment was three times over that of control.

The presence of long awns adhered at tip end of glumes is a characteristic feature of “Persian wheat” T. carthlicum Nevski spike. Glume outgrowth of T. carthlicum Nevski spike passes into a long awn, equal in length to the lemma awn. Awned glumes can be formed in T. aestivum and T. aethiopicum wheats, however, such forms are rare. Features of the awned glume development and the genetic determinants of this trait have been little studied. In this paper, we described the features of the development and inheritance of the tetra-awness (awned glume) trait of the bread wheat T. aestivum line CD 1167-8, using classical genetic analysis, molecular genetic mapping, and scanning electron microscopy. It was shown that the trait is inherited as a recessive monogenic. The gene for the awned glume trait of CD 1167-8 was mapped in the long arm of chromosome 5A, using the Illumina Infinium 15K Wheat Array (TraitGenetics GmbH), containing 15,000 SNPs associated with wheat genes. Results of allelism test and molecular-genetic mapping suggest that the gene for awned glumes in bread wheat is a recessive allele of the B1 awn suppressor. This new allele was designated the b1.ag (b1. awned glume). Analysis of the CD 1167-8 inflorescence development, using scanning electron microscopy, showed that awns had grown from the top of the lemmas and glumes simultaneously, and no differences in patterns of their development were found.',\n"," 'Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the varieties of which are widely used for the grain production, is difficultly crossable with related species of Triticeae Dum. This factor limits the chance of introduction of alien genetic material into the wheat gene pool and the possibility of new varieties breeding with good adaptation to adverse environmental factors. The crossability between wheat and related species is controlled by Kr1-Kr4 genes (Crossability with Rye, Hordeum and Aegilops spp.) and the SKr gene (Suppressor of crossability). SKr and Kr1 have the largest influence on the trait. In the case of the recessive alleles, these genes do not function and the quantity of hybrid seeds after pollination with alien species can achieve more than 50 %. SKr is located on 5BS between the GBR0233 and Xgwm234 markers, closely linked with the markers Xcfb341, TGlc2 and gene12. Kr1 was mapped on 5BL, proximally to the Ph1 gene, between the EST-SSR markers Xw5145 and Xw9340. The markers of SKr were used to control the transfer of its recessive allele into other wheat genotypes, which made it possible to obtain highly crossable forms. However, the advantages of using the SKr and Kr1 markers in marker-assisted selection and in the screening of ex situ collections are not sufficiently studied. The published Kr1 sequence for varieties with different crossability offers great prospects, because it will be possible to create allele-specific markers. In this review, the following issues are considered: genetic resources created by wheat and rye hybridization, the geographical distribution of easy-to-cross forms of wheat, genetic control of the wheat and rye compatibility, advances of the use of molecular markers in the mapping of Kr-genes and their transmission control.',\n"," 'Abstract The effects of the purified recombinant anabaena lipoxygenase (ana‐rLOX) on the rheological characteristics of whole wheat dough and the quality of bread were investigated. The lightness of whole wheat dough supplemented with ana‐rLOX was improved, which is superior to that of dough treated with benzoyl peroxide. The effect of ana‐rLOX on the strength of dough was analyzed by farinograph, extensograph, and dynamic rheological tests. Compared with the control, the stability time of dough treated with 40 IU/g ana‐rLOX increased by 35.4% and the farinograph quality number increased by 27.4%. In addition, the resistance to extension, as well as the elastic and viscous modulus, was improved by ana‐rLOX in a dose‐dependent manner. The height and specific volume of bread treated with ana‐rLOX increased by 17.3 and 15.2%, respectively, compared with the control, and the lightless, whiteness, and other textural parameters, such as hardness, springiness, chewiness, resilience, and gumminess, were significantly improved. Overall, the results of this study suggest the promising application of ana‐rLOX in enhancing quality of whole wheat flour.',\n"," 'Emergence of unharvested potatoes that survived during winter becomes source for nematodes and diseases, causing serious weed problems in rotational crop fields. Herein, we describe frost killing of unharvested potatoes in potato–wheat rotation fields using snow compaction ‘yuki-fumi’ under multiple climate conditions. The effect of snow compaction in controlling volunteer potato over winter wheat was verified in 17 farm fields in Hokkaido, Japan from 2015–16 to 2017–18. A reduction in the temperature of soil under ‘yuki-fumi’ was slower than that under snow removal ‘yuki-wari’, which was used in previous studies. However, snow compaction achieved a substantial reduction in volunteer potato sprouting in most of the experimental sites. The sprouting of volunteer potatoes was reduced in snow-compaction blocks with soil temperatures below −3°C. For winter wheat sowing in potato–wheat rotation, the soil is tilled to a shallower depth than that for other crops, and thus, unharvested potato tubers are not pushed down during field preparation for wheat sowing. Consequently, even if the soil temperature drops slightly, snow compaction can regulate the sprouting of volunteer potatoes. Snow compaction did not exert any apparent influence on wheat growth and grain yield. At some sites with a deeper snowpack, development of soil frost and reduction in soil temperature did not progress with continued snow compaction owing to fallen snow. We validated the usefulness of snow compaction as a countermeasure to control volunteer potatoes in snowy regions.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 play important roles in epigenetic gene regulation by posttranslationally modifying specific histone residues. Polycomb repressive complex 2 is responsible for the trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3; Polycomb repressive complex 1 catalyzes the monoubiquitination of histone H2A at lysine 119. Both complexes have been thoroughly studied in Arabidopsis, but the evolution of polycomb group gene families in monocots, particularly those with complex allopolyploid origins, is unknown. Results Here, we present the in silico identification of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC2, PRC1) subunits in allohexaploid bread wheat, the reconstruction of their evolutionary history and a transcriptional analysis over a series of 33 developmental stages. We identified four main subunits of PRC2 [E(z), Su(z), FIE and MSI] and three main subunits of PRC1 (Pc, Psc and Sce) and determined their chromosomal locations. We found that most of the genes coding for subunit proteins are present as paralogs in bread wheat. Using bread wheat RNA-seq data from different tissues and developmental stages throughout plant ontogenesis revealed variable transcriptional activity for individual paralogs. Phylogenetic analysis showed a high level of protein conservation among temperate cereals. Conclusions The identification and chromosomal location of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 core components in bread wheat may enable a deeper understanding of developmental processes, including vernalization, in commonly grown winter wheat.',\n"," 'Abstract Background The ability to engineer cereal crops by gene transfer technology is a powerful and informative tool for discovering and studying functions of genes controlling environmental adaptability and nutritional value. Tetraploid wheat species such as emmer wheat and Timopheevi wheat are the oldest cereal crops cultivated in various world areas long before the Christian era. Nowadays, these hulled wheat species are gaining new interest as donors for gene pools responsible for the improved grain yield and quality, tolerance for abiotic and biotic stress, resistance to pests and disease. The establishing of efficient gene transfer techniques for emmer and Timopheevi wheat may help in creation of modern polyploid wheat varieties. Results In the present study, we describe a robust protocol for the production of fertile transgenic plants of cultivated emmer wheat (Russian cv. ‘Runo’) using a biolistic delivery of a plasmid encoding the gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an herbicide resistance gene (BAR). Both the origin of target tissues (mature or immature embryos) and the type of morphogenic calli (white or translucent) influenced the efficiency of stable transgenic plant production in emmer wheat. The bombardment of nodular white compact calluses is a major factor allowed to achieve the highest transformation efficiency of emmer wheat (on average, 12.9%) confirmed by fluorescence, PCR, and Southern blot. In the absence of donor plants for isolation of immature embryos, mature embryo-derived calluses could be used as alternative tissues for recovering transgenic emmer plants with a frequency of 2.1%. The biolistic procedure based on the bombardment of immature embryo-derived calluses was also successful for the generation of transgenic Triticum timopheevii wheat plants (transformation efficiency of 0.5%). Most of the primary events transmitted the transgene expression to the sexual progeny. Conclusion The procedures described here can be further used to study the functional biology and contribute to the agronomic improvement of wheat. We also recommend involving in such research the Russian emmer wheat cv. ‘Runo’, which demonstrates a high capacity for biolistic-mediated transformation, exceeding the previously reported values for different genotypes of polyploid wheat.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.) is one of the most dangerous diseases of common wheat worldwide. Three approaches: genome-wide association study (GWAS), marker-assisted selection (MAS) and phytopathological evaluation in field, were used for assessment of the genetic diversity of Russian spring wheat varieties on leaf rust resistance loci and for identification of associated molecular markers. Results The collection, consisting of 100 Russian varieties of spring wheat, was evaluated over three seasons for resistance to the native population of leaf rust specific to the West Siberian region of Russia. The results indicated that most cultivars showed high susceptibility to P. triticina, with severity ratings (SR) of 60S–90S, however some cultivars showed a high level of leaf rust resistance (SR',\n"," 'Abstract Background Plant height is an important wheat trait that is regulated by multiple genes, among which Rht is of the utmost value. In wheat, Rht-B1p (=Rht17) is a mutant allele of the Rht gene that encodes for a DELLA-protein and results in the development of gibberellin-insensitive plants with a dwarfing phenotype. The pleiotropic effects of dwarfing genes on yield are highly dependent on both the genetic background and the environmental conditions. In Russia, the Central Non-Black Earth Region and Krasnodar Krai are two economically important regions that require differing management for sustainable wheat production for food, feed and industry. The purpose of our study was to compare the pleiotropic effects of Rht-B1p on the main valuable agronomic traits in the F3:4 families of the spring bread wheat Chris Mutant/Novosibirskaya 67 in the genetic background of Vrn-B1a/vrn-B1 (spring/winter phenotype) and Ppd-D1a/Ppd-D1b (insensitivity/sensitivity to photoperiod) alleles in a field experiment in Moscow and Krasnodar Krai. Results Plant height was reduced on average by 21 cm (28%) and 25 cm (30%), respectively; Ppd-D1a slightly strengthened the dwarfing effect in Moscow and mitigated it in Krasnodar Krai. Grain weight of the main spike was reduced by Rht-B1p in Moscow and to lesser extent in Krasnodar; Ppd-D1a and Vrn-B1a tended to partially compensate for this loss in Krasnodar Krai. Thousand grain weight was reduced on average by 5.3 g (16%) and 2.9 g (10%) in Moscow and Krasnodar Krai, respectively, but was partially compensated for by Ppd-D1a in Krasnodar Krai. Harvest index was increased due to Rht-B1p by 6 and 10% in Moscow and Krasnodar Krai, respectively. Rht-B1p resulted in a delay of heading by 1–2 days in Moscow. Ppd-D1a accelerated heading by 1 day and 6 days in Moscow and in Krasnodar Krai, respectively. Conclusions Rht-B1p could be introduced into wheat breeding along with dwarfing genes such as Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b. Special attention should be paid to its combination with Ppd-D1a and Vrn-B1a as regulators of developmental rates, compensators of adverse effects of Rht-B1p on productivity and enhancers of positive effect of Rht-B1p on harvest index.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Ecological environments shape plant architecture and alter the growing season, which provides the basis for wheat genetic improvement. Therefore, understanding the genetic basis of grain yield and yield-related traits in specific ecological environments is important. Results A structured panel of 96 elite wheat cultivars grown in the High-yield zone of Henan province in China was genotyped using an Illumina iSelect 90 K SNP assay. Selection pressure derived from ecological environments of mountain front and plain region provided the initial impetus for population divergence. This determined the dominant traits in two subpopulations (spike number and spike percentage were dominance in subpopulation 2:1; thousand-kernel weight, grain filling rate (GFR), maturity date (MD), and fertility period (FP) were dominance in subpopulation 2:2), which was also consistent with their inheritance from the donor parents. Genome wide association studies identified 107 significant SNPs for 12 yield-related traits and 10 regions were pleiotropic to multiple traits. Especially, GY was co-located with MD/FP, GFR and HD at QTL-ple5A, QTL-ple7A.1 and QTL-ple7B.1 region. Further selective sweep analysis revealled that regions under selection were around QTLs for these traits. Especially, grain yield (GY) is positively correlated with MD/FP and they were co-located at the VRN-1A locus. Besides, a selective sweep signal was detected at VRN-1B locus which was only significance to MD/FP. Conclusions The results indicated that extensive differential in allele frequency driven by ecological selection has shaped plant architecture and growing season during yield improvement. The QTLs for yield and yield components detected in this study probably be selectively applied in molecular breeding.',\n"," 'High content of mineral salts reduces crop yields. Agricultural areas are being reduced due to the secondary salinization of land. Wheat is one of the main crops, however, wheat is a type of plant that is sensitive to the toxic effects of mineral salts. Therefore, the identification of cytological and biochemical markers for determining resistant and sensitive wheat varieties to abiotic stress caused by the toxic effects of mineral salts is one of the important tasks of agriculture. Methods of fluorescence, cytophotometry, electrophoresis, and light-optical microscopy produced suitable cytological markers for creating a test system for the early diagnosis of wheat sensitivity to the tested salts. Different wheat genotypes of Triticum aestivum Host. (varieties Agata, Uchitel’, and Zhemchuzhina Povolzh’ya) underwent treatment to investigate their reaction to the toxic effects of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate. The varieties responded differently to the presence of the salts; these were reflected in changes in biometric data, the passage of the cell cycle, features of ROS accumulation, and a quantitative assessment of the viability of seedling cells. In the genotypes sensitive to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate (varieties Zhemchuzhina Povolzh’ya and Uchitel’), tissue damage was observed in root cells under toxic effects, while in the resistant genotype (variety Agata) cell damage was minimal. The developed complex of intravital markers of various wheat genotypes in the early development stages can be effectively used to characterize wheat with different tolerance to chloride and sulfate salinization.',\n"," 'Introgression from wild relatives is a valuable source of novel allelic diversity for breeding. We investigated the genomic patterns of introgression from Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars. The population of 351 BC1F3:5 lines was selected based on phenology from crosses between six hexaploid wheat lines and 21 wheat-Ae. tauschii octoploids. SNP markers developed for this population and a diverse panel of 116 Ae. tauschii accessions by complexity-reduced genome sequencing were used to detect introgression based on the identity-by-descent analysis. Overall, introgression frequency positively correlated with recombination rate, with a high incidence of introgression at the ends of chromosomes and low in the pericentromeric regions, and was negatively related to sequence divergence between the parental genomes. Reduced introgression in the pericentromeric low-recombining regions spans nearly 2/3 of each chromosome arm, suggestive of the polygenic nature of introgression barriers that could be associated with multilocus negative epistasis between the alleles of wild and cultivated wheat. On the contrary, negative selection against the wild allele of Tg, controlling free-threshing trait and located in the high-recombining chromosomal region, led to reduced introgression only within ∼10 Mbp region around Tg. These results are consistent with the effect of selection on linked variation described by the Hill-Robertson effect, and offer insights into the introgression population development for crop improvement to maximize retention of introgressed diversity across entire genome.',\n"," 'Abstract Background Agricultural yield is closely associated with nitrogen application. Thus, reducing the application of nitrogen without affecting agricultural production remains a challenging task. To understand the metabolic, physiological, and morphological response of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to nitrogen deficiency, it is crucial to identify the genes involved in the activated signaling pathways. Results We conducted a hydroponic experiment using a complete nutrient solution (N1) and a nutrient solution without nitrogen (N0). Wheat plants under nitrogen-deficient conditions (NDC) showed decreased crop height, leaf area, root volume, photosynthetic rate, crop weight, and increased root length, root surface area, root/shoot ratio. It indicates that nitrogen deficiency altered the phenotype of wheat plants. Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, transcriptome, GO pathways, and KEGG pathways of DEGs identified in wheat grown under NDC. It showed up-regulation of Exp (24), and Nrt (9) gene family members, which increased the nitrogen absorption and down-regulation of Pet (3), Psb (8), Nar (3), and Nir (1) gene family members hampered photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. Conclusions We identified 48 candidate genes that were involved in improved photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism in wheat plants grown under NDC. These genes may serve as molecular markers for genetic breeding of crops.',\n"," 'Abstract Protein derived from purple wheat bran was hydrolyzed sequentially using alcalase proteases for the production of antioxidant peptides. Purple wheat bran protein (PWBP) hydrolysates were fractionated using size-exclusion (G-25) and ion-exchange chromatography methods to identify the structure of antioxidant peptides. The free radical scavenging activity of peptides purified from PWBP hydrolysates was evaluated using superoxide anion radical-scavenging activity and determination assays of Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC). Results demonstrated that purple wheat bran peptide F4-4 exhibited the highest antioxidant activity among other hydrolysates. F4-4 was further identified as Cys-Gly-Phe-Pro-Gly-His-Cys, Gln-Ala-Cys, Arg-Asn-Phe, Ser-Ser-Cys, and Trp-Phe by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) spectrometer coupled with Orbitrap Elite™ mass spectrometer (LC–MS/MS). Antioxidant peptides 2 and 4 showed improved stability when the temperature was lower than 80 °C. These peptides also demonstrated good digestive stability in vitro system by simulating gastrointestinal digestion.',\n"," 'This study was focused on the chemical analysis of the mixtures of wheat flour with rosehip powder. Different types of wheat flours, i.e., white flour (WF), intermediate wheat flour (IWF), whole wheat flour (WWF) and wheat flour with bran (WFB), and various amounts of rosehip powder (Rp), i.e., 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 % were used to obtain several flour mixtures whose proximate composition and physical properties were determined. The data show that chemical composition of the flours is modified by the addition of Rp: the moisture, protein and wet gluten content decreases and the ash content increases with an increased addition of Rp. One-way ANOVA showed significant differences (p < 0.05) between flour mixtures, separately for each type of flour. The in-depth analysis of the quality indicators of flours reveals that the wet gluten content corresponds to the optimal level only for all the WF-Rp mixtures. This leads to the selection of the WF-Rp to obtain bread and study the influence of Rp addition on bread properties in future research.',\n"," '© 2019 Elsevier Ltd The molecular structural changes in starch in barley malts during mashing (a major step in brewing beer) with and without protein removal were investigated using size exclusion chromatography. The aim was to uncover how proteins affects barley starch degradation in brewing. It was found that for malts containing lower β-amylase activity, protein removal significantly increased fermentable sugar content, whilst no significant change was observed for malts with higher β-amylase, with or without addition of a metalloprotease (Neutrase®). However, metalloprotease addition significantly reduced both the content and molecular sizes of remaining wort-soluble starches. This suggests that the effects of malt protein removal on starch degradation, particularly on fermentable sugar production, largely depend on malt enzyme activity, especially that of β-amylase. This provides useful information for brewers: for example, the fact that soluble starch molecular structure correlates significantly with fermentation efficiency gives a new criterion for selecting barley varieties for optimal brewing performance.',\n"," 'En cebada, la luz y la temperatura controlan la floración a través de la interacción entre los genes de vernalización y fotoperíodo.

Here, we exposed hydroponically grown barley plants to three levels of PAR [Normal (control), Low, High] and focused on the role which aquaporins (AQPs), apoplastic barriers (Casparian bands, suberin lamellae) and root morphology play in the adjustment of root hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Plants were analyzed when they were 14-18 days (d) old. Root and cell Lp, which involves AQP activity, was determined through exudation and cell pressure probe measurements, respectively. Gene expression of AQPs was analyzed through qPCR. The formation of apoplastic barriers was studied through staining of cross-sections. The rate of transpirational water loss per plant and unit leaf area increased in response to high-PAR and decreased in response to low-PAR treatments, both during day and night. Hydraulic conductivity in roots decreased significantly at organ and cell level in response to Low-PAR, and increased (organ) or did not change (cell level) in response to High-PAR. The formation of apoplastic barriers was little affected by PAR. Gene expression of AQPs tended to be highest in the Low-PAR treatment. Lateral roots, showing few apoplastic barriers, contributed the least in Low- and the most to root surface area in High-PAR plants. It is concluded that barley plants which experience changes in shoot transpirational water loss in response to PAR adjust root water uptake through changes in root Lp, and that these changes are mediated through altered AQP activity and root morphology.

However, the extent to which yield is influenced by the timing and duration of waterlogging relative to crop phenology is unknown. To investigate this, we conducted a range of waterlogging treatments on modern barley genotypes differing in their waterlogging tolerance, with tolerance conferred through aerenchyma formation under oxygen deficit conditions. Experiment 1 was conducted in a controlled environment using four waterlogging treatments: waterlogging at Zadoks stage (ZS) 12.5 for 1 or 2 months (WL1 and WL2, respectively), waterlogging at ZS 15 for 2 months (WL3), and waterlogging initiated 1 day before heading for 15 days (WL4). Experiment 2 was conducted in the field with WL2. Averaged across experiments, yield was reduced by 35% in W1 to 52% in WL3 due to fewer spikes/m.sup.2 and kernels/spike. WL4 had the greatest impact on yield (70% reduction) due to its effect on spikelet fertility and grain filling. Phenology was delayed 1-8 ZS at the end of waterlogging treatments, with the waterlogging-susceptible cultivar Franklin showing the greatest delays, and waterlogging tolerant genotypes (Macquarie+, TAMF169) capable of aerenchyma formation under waterlogging having the least delays (0-4 ZS). Genotypes with aerenchyma formation QTL (Macquarie+) showed nonsignificant yield reduction compared with nonwaterlogged controls, preventing 23% yield loss under early phenological waterlogging stress. Late growth stage waterlogging substantially reduced average final grain yield by 70%. CAPTION(S): Figure S1 Figure S2 Byline: Ke Liu, Matthew Tom Harrison, Ahmed Ibrahim, S. M.

We discover that these isozymes catalyse the transglycosylation reactions with the chemically defined donor and acceptor substrates, specifically with the xyloglucan donor and the penta-galacturonide [[alpha](1-4)GalAp].sub.5 acceptor - the homogalacturonan (pectin) fragment. This activity is supported by 3D molecular models of HvXET3 and HvXET4 with the docked XXXG donor and [[alpha](1-4)GalAp].sub.5 acceptor substrates at the -4 to +5 subsites in the active sites. Comparative sequence analyses of barley isoforms and seed-localised TmXET6.3 from nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus L.) permitted the engineering of mutants of TmXET6.3 that could catalyse the hetero-transglycosylation reaction with the xyloglucan/[[alpha](1-4)GalAp].sub.5 substrate pair, while wild-type TmXET6.3 lacked this activity. Expression data obtained by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction of HvXET transcripts and a clustered heatmap of expression profiles of the gene family revealed that HvXET3 and HvXET6 co-expressed but did not share the monophyletic origin. Conversely, HvXET3 and HvXET4 shared this relationship, when we examined the evolutionary history of 419 glycoside hydrolase 16 family members, spanning monocots, eudicots and a basal Angiosperm. The discovered hetero-transglycosylation activity in HvXET3 and HvXET4 with the xyloglucan/[[alpha](1-4)GalAp].sub.5 substrate pair is discussed against the background of roles of xyloglucan-pectin heteropolymers and how they may participate in spatial patterns of cell wall formation and re-modelling, and affect the structural features of walls.

The intake of dietary fiber, especially soluble dietary fiber, is limited and demands researcher's attention. The modification of cereal's dietary fiber, predominantly insoluble fiber, could be one possible solution. The current study evaluated the comparative effects of several thermal treatments on the modification of insoluble dietary fiber in barley and explored their therapeutic potential in vivo against hypercholesterolemia. The two cultivars of barley, Haider-93 and Jau-87, were thermally treated using different techniques, and dietary fiber was extracted. Successively, the intake of these dietary fibers was evaluated for its antilipidemic activity in normal and hypercholesterolemic rats. In the first phase, thermal treatments especially cooking without soaking increased the soluble fiber (68.08%). The roasting all increased the soluble fiber contents, however, at relatively lower rate (53.91%). The results of efficacy study revealed that biochemical parameters in control animals were within the normal clinical ranges, thus appraising the safe status of the experimental diets. The thermally treated barley fiber decreased total cholesterol (12.14%-12.63%), low-density lipoprotein (14.12%-14.85%), and triglycerides (2.25%-4.32%). The study recorded increasing trends for high-density lipoprotein in both normal and hypercholesterolemic rats. In the nutshell, thermal modification of dietary fiber increased the ratio of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber that improved its hypocholesterolemic potential. The thermally treated barley dietary fiber is effective in reducing the lipid profile in Sprague-dawley rats than untreated dietary fiber and, therefore, can be considered as a functional food and ingredient to cope different lifestyle diseases.

Barley was steeped for 24 hr followed by 72 hr germination in room temperature (25 [+ or -] 3[degrees]C). Germinated barley was dried (45[degrees]C/6 hr, 50[degrees]C/4 hr, 55[degrees]C/8 hr, 70[degrees]C/1 hr, 80[degrees]C/3 hr) in a cabinet drier. Multistage dried barley was then ground to pass through a 250 [micro]m screen. Among the chemical composition, protein and reducing sugar were affected by genotype (p < .05) in barley except for [beta]-glucan. Functional properties, particularly bulk density, water absorption capacity, oil absorption capacity, and viscosity, were affected by genotype (p < .05) in barley, whereas except for density, all the parameters were different (p < .05) for malt. The highest diastatic power among all genotypes was recorded for solu uwa (329.25 A*DP) followed by Muktinath (271.15 A*DP). There was no significant change (p < .05) in a protein of all genotypes after malting, whereas [beta]-glucan and viscosity significantly decreased (p < .05) for all genotypes after malting. The remaining parameters for all genotypes were not affected (p < .05) by malting. Solu uwa had higher enzymatic activity, whereas Xveola-38 and Muktinath were found to be better for complimentary food preparation. Byline: Pravin Ojha, Nagina Gautam, Ujjwol Subedi, Narayan B.

This study was designed to address such important details and to gain insights into molecular responses of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to drought stress. To that, we combined RNA-seq data analysis with field and greenhouse drought experiments in a systems biology approach. RNA-sequence analysis identified a total of 665 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belonging to diverse functional categories. A gene network was derived from the DEGs, which comprised of a total of 131 nodes and 257 edges. Gene network topology analysis highlighted two programmed cell death (PCD) modulating genes, MC1 (metacaspase 1) and TSN1 (Tudor-SN 1), as important (hub) genes in the predicted network. Based on the field trial, a drought-tolerant and a drought-susceptible barley genotype was identified from eight tested cultivars. Identified genotypes exhibited different physiochemical characteristics, including proline content, chlorophyll concentration, percentage of electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde content as well as expression profiles of MC1 and TSN1 genes. Machine learning and correspondence analysis revealed a significant relationship between drought tolerance and measured characteristics in the context of PCD. Our study provides new insights which bridge barley drought tolerance to PCD through MC1 and TSN1 pathway. Article Note: Edited by R. Rivero CAPTION(S): Table S1.

Here, we investigated the drought response of a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mutant carrying a missense mutation in the gene encoding the SL-specific receptor HvD14. Our results clearly showed that hvd14.d mutant is hyper-sensitive to drought stress. This was illustrated by a lower leaf relative water content (RWC), impaired photosynthesis, disorganization of chloroplast structure, altered stomatal density and slower closure of stomata in response to drought in the mutant compared to the wild type parent cultivar Sebastian. Although the content of abscisic acid (ABA) and its derivatives remained unchanged in the mutant, significant differences in expression of genes related to ABA biosynthesis were observed. Moreover, hvd14.d was insensitive to ABA during seed germination. Analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana mutant atd14-1 also demonstrated that mutation in the SL receptor resulted in increased sensitivity to drought. Our results indicate that the drought-sensitive phenotype of barley SL mutant might be caused by a disturbed ABA metabolism and/or signalling pathways. These results together uncovered a link between SL signalling and ABA-dependent drought stress response in barley.

In the present-day situation, the problems pertaining to the nutritional quality of food and feed are quite pertinent for fodder production and cereal farming. The prospect to exploit hulless barley is regarded as a promising trend of agricultural research, because its grain contains chemical compounds of higher value than those in hulled barley. However, among the limiting factors of hulless barley cultivation, low yield should be mentioned, along with poor lodging resistance and susceptibility to fungal diseases. Therefore, the task of searching for and comprehensive studying of source material for hulless barley breeding is essential as the first step towards the development of high-yielding and adaptable cultivars.Materials and methods. Twenty hulless barley accessions, representing 15 botanical varieties, served as the target material for the study. Their genotypes were evaluated in the northern forest steppe environments of Tyumen Province (2015– 2017) according to the guidelines developed by the N.I. Vavilov All-Russian Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR) and field trial methods by B. A. Dospekhov. Correlation analysis was used for statistical processing of experimental data.Results and conclusion. The degree of interactions between the studied characters was measured, and their effect size in the formation of the yield was shown for hulless barley accessions. An inverse correlation of medium strength (r = –0.37) was observed between plant height and lodging resistance, and a direct relationship between plant height and yield was recorded (r = 0.37). The yield was most closely associated with grain weight per plant (r = 0.61) and 1000 grain weight (r = 0.54). The research results showed that C.I.10975 (k-30624, Ethiopia), Liguleless (k-29894, Tajikistan), Schwarze Nackte Kraftborn (k-25788, Germany) and ‘De printempe’ (k-23491, France) had relatively high yield combined with a number of other useful traits.',\n"," 'Introduction. Barley can be infected with a broad variety of fungi, which can cause considerable loss of crop yield and reduce the quality of grain. Modern vision on the geographical and ecological distribution and biodiversity of micromycetes has been established by traditional, cultivation-based methods. However, more recently, molecular methods have shifted microbiological research to a new level, making it possible to investigate hidden taxonomical biodiversity. Study objects and methods. For this study, we determined the fungal biome on the surface and inside of barley grains using the traditional mycological method and the contemporary molecular method, which employed DNA metabarcoding based on NGS (nextgeneration sequencing) of the ITS2 region. We analyzed five cultivars that were collected in two subsequent crop seasons (2014, 2015). Results and discussion. DNA metabarcoding revealed 43 operational taxonomic units, while 17 taxa of genus or species level were recovered by the traditional method. DNA metabarcoding revealed several minor species and one predominant, presumably plantpathogenic Phaeosphaeria sp., which were not detected in the agar plate-based assay. Traditionally, Fusarium fungi were identified by mycological assay. However, the resolution of DNA metabarcoding was sufficient to determine main Fusarium groups divided by ability to produce toxic secondary metabolites. The combined list of Ascomycetes consisted of 15 genera, including 14 fungi identified to species level. The list of Basidiomycota derived from DNA metabarcoding data alone included 8 genera. Conclusion. It was found that crop season predetermines the fungal community structure; mycobiota on the surface and inside of grain was significantly different. Keywords',\n"," \"Abstract Dietary fiber is a nondigestible constituent of vegetal foods, formed by insoluble and soluble dietary fiber. The intake of dietary fiber, especially soluble dietary fiber, is limited and demands researcher's attention. The modification of cereal's dietary fiber, predominantly insoluble fiber, could be one possible solution. The current study evaluated the comparative effects of several thermal treatments on the modification of insoluble dietary fiber in barley and explored their therapeutic potential in vivo against hypercholesterolemia. The two cultivars of barley, Haider‐93 and Jau‐87, were thermally treated using different techniques, and dietary fiber was extracted. Successively, the intake of these dietary fibers was evaluated for its antilipidemic activity in normal and hypercholesterolemic rats. In the first phase, thermal treatments especially cooking without soaking increased the soluble fiber (68.08%). The roasting all increased the soluble fiber contents, however, at relatively lower rate (53.91%). The results of efficacy study revealed that biochemical parameters in control animals were within the normal clinical ranges, thus appraising the safe status of the experimental diets. The thermally treated barley fiber decreased total cholesterol (12.14%–12.63%), low‐density lipoprotein (14.12%–14.85%), and triglycerides (2.25%–4.32%). The study recorded increasing trends for high‐density lipoprotein in both normal and hypercholesterolemic rats. In the nutshell, thermal modification of dietary fiber increased the ratio of soluble to insoluble dietary fiber that improved its hypocholesterolemic potential. The thermally treated barley dietary fiber is effective in reducing the lipid profile in Sprague–dawley rats than untreated dietary fiber and, therefore, can be considered as a functional food and ingredient to cope different lifestyle diseases.\",\n"," 'Abstract Background A family of genes designated as the Zinc finger A20/AN1 Transcription factors encoding stress-associated proteins (SAP) are well described in Arabidopsis and rice, and include 14 AtSAP and 18 OsSAP genes that are associated with variable tolerances to multiple abiotic stresses. The SAP gene family displays a great diversity in its structure and across different plant species. The aim of this study was to identify all HvSAP genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), to analyse the expression of selected genes in response to salinity in barley leaves and develop SNP marker for HvSAP12 to evaluate the association between genotypes of barley plants and their grain yield in field trials. Results In our study, 17 HvSAP genes were identified in barley, which were strongly homologous to rice genes. Five genes, HvSAP5, HvSAP6, HvSAP11, HvSAP12 and HvSAP15, were found to be highly expressed in leaves of barley plants in response to salt stress in hydroponics compared to controls, using both semi-quantitative RT-PCR and qPCR analyses. The Amplifluor-like SNP marker KATU-B30 was developed and used for HvSAP12 genotyping. A strong association (R2 = 0.85) was found between KATU-B30 and grain yield production per plant of 50 F3 breeding lines originating from the cross Granal × Baisheshek in field trials with drought and low to moderate salinity in Northern and Central Kazakhstan. Conclusions A group of HvSAP genes, and HvSAP12 in particular, play an important role in the tolerance of barley plants to salinity and drought, and is associated with higher grain yield in field trials. Marker-assisted selection with SNP marker KATU-B30 can be applied in barley breeding to improve grain yield production under conditions of abiotic stress.',\n"," 'Abstract Background The naked caryopsis character in barley is a domestication-associated trait defined by loss-of-function of the NUD gene. The functional NUD gene encodes an Apetala 2/Ethylene-Response Factor (AP2/ERF) controlling the formation of a cementing layer between pericarp and both lemma and palea. The downstream genes regulated by the NUD transcription factor and molecular mechanism of a cementing layer formation are still not sufficiently described. A naturally occurring 17-kb deletion in the nud locus is associated with the emergence of naked barley. Naked barley has been traditionally used for food and nowadays is considered as a dietary component for functional nutrition. Results In the present study, we demonstrate that targeted knockout of the NUD gene using RNA-guided Cas9 endonuclease leads to the phenotype conversion from hulled to naked barley. Using in vivo pre-testing systems, highly effective guide RNAs targeting the first exon of the NUD gene were selected. Expression cassettes harboring the cas9 and guide RNA genes were used to transform barley cv. Golden Promise via Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transfer. The recessive naked grain phenotype was observed in 57% of primary transformants, which indicates a frequent occurrence of homozygous or biallelic mutations. T-DNA-free homozygous lines with independently generated mutations in the NUD gene were obtained in the T1 generation. At homozygous state, all obtained mutations including one- and two-amino acid losses with the translational reading frame being retained invariably caused the naked grain phenotype. Conclusions The hulled and naked barley isogenic lines generated are a perfect experimental model for further studies on pleiotropic consequences of nud mutations on overall plant performance under particular consideration of yield-determining traits. Due to the high β-glucan content of its grains, naked barley is considered as being of particular dietary value. The possibility to convert hulled into naked barley cultivars by targeted mutagenesis allows breeders to extend the potential utilization of barley by the provision of functional food.',\n"," 'The studies aimed to determine the effect of feed rations containing hulled or hull- less barley meal on the slaughter parameters and the quality of muscles in broiler chickens. The experiment involved 120 broiler chickens of Ross 308 split into 3 groups (K, DI, DII), each consisting of 40 birds. Until the 21st day of life the birds were fed ad libitum with ground starter rations, and from day 22 to day 42 they received grower rations based on wheat, soybean meal, and soya oil with an admixture of minerals and vitamins. In the control rations the second cereal was corn, and the experimental rations contained 30% hulled barley (DI) or hull-less barley (DII). The best slaughter parameters were recorded for chickens from group DI. They had the largest share of total muscles including thigh and drumsticks as well as the smallest share of abdominal fat and skin with subcutaneous fat compared to others. The intramuscular fat of experimental birds contained significantly less PUFA than that of the control birds. In terms of taste, the best note the muscles of chickens fed mixtures containing husked barley were rated. The mean of the traits of breast muscle of chickens in this group was higher (P≤0.05) compared to others. The slaughter parameters obtained in the study provide grounds for recommending the use of hulled barley in rations for broiler chickens accounting for 30% of the ration weight.',\n"," 'Abstract There has been very limited work on the malting quality of barley grown in Nepal. This work used completely randomized experiment for seven barley genotypes, namely Xveola‐45, Coll#112‐114/Muktinath, Xveola‐38, Solu uwa, NB‐1003/37‐1038, NB‐1003/37‐1034, and Bonus, collected from Hill Crop Research Program (Dolakha, Nepal) to study the effect of genotypes on the chemical composition and functional properties of barley and malt. Barley was steeped for 24 hr followed by 72 hr germination in room temperature (25 ± 3°C). Germinated barley was dried (45°C/6 hr, 50°C/4 hr, 55°C/8 hr, 70°C/1 hr, 80°C/3 hr) in a cabinet drier.

Two barley particle sizes (fine and coarse) and 4 enzyme treatments (nonsupplemented [control], carbohydrase [0.15 g/kg of feed; Carb], phytase [0.10 g/kg; Phy] and combination of carbohydrase and phytase [0.15 and 0.10 g/kg, respectively; Carb + Phy]) were evaluated in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement. Fine and coarse barley particles were achieved by grinding whole barley in a hammer mill to pass through 2.0 and 8.0 mm screens, respectively. A total of 384, 1-day-old male broilers (8 birds/cage; 6 cages/treatment) were used. Supplemental enzymes tended (P = 0.056) to increase the weight gain of birds with a synergetic effect from Carb + Phy. The response of feed intake to supplemental enzymes interacted (P 0.05) affected the jejunal digesta viscosity. In summary, feeding coarse barley particles and supplemental Carb improved the feed efficiency and nutrient and energy utilization. The effects of barley particle size on measured parameters suggest that the particle size effect was preserved even after pelleting. The combination of Carb and Phy tended to improve the weight gain but caused no further improvements in nutrient utilization.',\n"," 'The weed species in the common barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) fields in the Diyarbakir were observed with this study. For this purpose, 50 quadrats of 1m by 1m (1 m-2) were randomly placed and examined at each study site. In every set of the quadrat, frequency and density were observed throughout the cropping season of 2015-2016. During the course of field study 72 weed species belonging to 21 families, 13 grasses, 59 broadleaves were recorded. The common families were Asteraceae and Poaceae in the common barley fields. The encounter frequency of weeds was determined by observing 80% wild mustard (Sinapis arvensis L., 80%), animated oat (Avena sterilis L., 63%), common wild oat (Avena fatua L., 54%), corn buttercup (Ranunculus arvensis L., 54%), corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas L., 52%), creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.)

The infection of plant viruses can produce large numbers of vsiRNAs, which can target host transcripts and cause symptom development. However, few studies have been conducted to explore the role played by vsiRNAs in the interaction between BYDV-GAV and host wheat plants. Methods In this study, small RNA sequencing was conducted to profile vsiRNAs in BYDV-GAV-infected wheat plants. The putative targets of vsiRNAs were predicted by the bioinformatics software psRNATarget. RT-qPCR and VIGS were employed to identify the function of selected target transcripts. To confirm the interaction between vsiRNA and the target, 5′ RACE was performed to analyze the specific cleavage sites. Results From the sequencing data, we obtained a total of 11,384 detected vsiRNAs. The length distribution of these vsiRNAs was mostly 21 and 22 nt, and an A/U bias was observed at the 5′ terminus. We also observed that the production region of vsiRNAs had no strand polarity. The vsiRNAs were predicted to target 23,719 wheat transcripts. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis demonstrated that these targets were mostly involved in cell components, catalytic activity and plant-pathogen interactions. The results of RT-qPCR analysis showed that most chloroplast-related genes were downregulated in BYDV-GAV-infected wheat plants. Silencing of a chlorophyll synthase gene caused leaf yellowing that was similar to the symptoms exhibited by BYDV-GAV-inoculated wheat plants. A vsiRNA from an overlapping region of BYDV-GAV MP and CP was observed to target chlorophyll synthase for gene silencing. Next, 5′ RACE validated that vsiRNA8856 could cleave the chlorophyll synthase transcript in a sequence-specific manner. Conclusions This report is the first to demonstrate that BYDV-GAV-derived vsiRNAs can target wheat transcripts for symptom development, and the results of this study help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf yellowing after viral infection.\",\n"," 'Highlights •High moisture airtight storage of barley with enzymes enhanced P and N solubility.•High moisture airtight stored barley with enzymes enhanced P digestibility in pigs.•The enhancing effect was smaller when barley was fed together with soybean meal.•High moisture stored barley with enzyme shifted P excretion from feces to urine.',\n"," 'Highlights •The four colored naked barley showed a diversity in phenolic compounds profile.•The all colored samples had differences in contents of phenolic compounds.•There were significant differences in antioxidant ability of colored naked barley.•There were significant correlation between phenolic components and antioxidation.',\n"," 'Highlights •Germination changed the phenolic compounds in naked barley.•The content of phenolic compounds increased as germination prolonged to 36 h.•Infrared drying had greater phenolic compounds retention than hot air drying.•Phenolic compounds in raw and treated barley differentiated by PLS-DA.',\n"," 'Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) of barley, caused by the fungal pathogen Ramularia collo-cygni, is a significant threat to the viability of spring barley production in Ireland. As a relatively new disease of barley, limited information is available on the development and impact of the disease under Irish conditions. RLS symptoms often only develop after anthesis and the final fungicide application, therefore some decision support is required for growers to be able to make sound integrated pest management (IPM) decisions. In the present study field trials were conducted on spring barley in 2016–2018 to determine if environmental conditions during stem extension, specifically leaf wetness, could be used to aid decisions relating to the intensity of fungicide control required later in the season for the control of RLS. The trials were conducted on four spring barley varieties subjected to one of five fungicide treatments at awn emergence 1) untreated control 2) pyraclostrobin 3) prothioconazole and chlorothalonil 4) decreased/increased rates of prothioconazole and chlrothalonil depending on risk of RLS development and 5) exclusion of prothioconazole or addition of bixafen depending on risk of RLS development. In 2018, although moderate-high levels of disease were predicted, a prolonged dry period post-stem extension resulted in no disease development. In 2016, 2017 moderate levels of disease developed in the trials, with various significant (P < 0.05) interactions recorded between site, year, variety and fungicide treatment, depending on specific variable assessed: visual leaf symptoms, pathogen load in the leaf or grain as determined by qPCR or final grain yield. This was further evident in the relationships between visual symptoms and detectable R. collo-cygni biomass in the leaf with yield, these contrasted between seasons with weak relationships detected in 2016 (R2 = −0.019 and R2 = 0.176 for visual and biomass respectively) and strong relationships detected in 2017 (R2 = −0.748 and R2 = −0.5 for visual and biomass respectively). The variability in responses to the variety and fungicide treatments and the relationships between visual disease symptoms and biomass further highlight the unpredictability of RLS.',\n"," 'Global change is bringing barley with more frequency of suffering from high temperature.

Thus, the goal of this study is to simulate application of photovoltaic (PV) system as an alternative clean energy supplier to achieve energy-environmental sustainability under two irrigation methods, namely, surface irrigation (SFI) and sprinkler irrigation (SPI) in barley cultivation. Data are collected during the growing season of 2018–2019 from a 100-ha farm located in central region of Hamedan province, Iran. Moreover, applying PV system to SFI and SPI scenarios, which are simulated by using TRNSYS software, generate SFI-PV and SPI-PV scenarios, respectively.

However, these days it is gaining popularity as “functional grain” because it contains higher amounts of bioactive compounds including β-glucan (4–11%) and phytochemicals. The health benefits of barley β-glucan and other bioactive compounds have been well documented. β-Glucan is the most unique polysaccharide of barley which is associated with numerous health benefits including reduction of cholesterol, manage post postprandial blood glucose levels and acts as an anti-cancerous agent. Since food grains including barley are consumed after processing and it may alter the solubility, molecular weight and extractability of β-glucan affecting the health benefits. Therefore, it is important to know the processing effects on β-glucan to confirm such health claims for barley. Most of the review papers published are focused on the health benefits of β-glucan. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive report is available on the effects of barley processing on β-glucan content, molecular weight and β-glucan extractability.

Eight second-parity Holstein cows (62 ± 2 d in milk; milk yield = 54 ± 1.2 kg/d; body weight = 624 ± 26; all mean ± SE) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design during 4 periods of 21 d. Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments that were a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of 2 grain sources (corn or barley) and 2 levels of BP inclusion [5 or 15% of dry matter (DM)] in the diet: (1) barley-based diet with BP at 5% of dietary DM; (2) barley-based diet with BP at 15% of dietary DM; (3) corn-based diet with BP at 5% of dietary DM; and (4) corn-based diet with BP at 15% of dietary DM. The increasing amount of BP in the diet was at the expense of decreasing an equal proportion of grain (barley or corn). All diets were high in concentrates (65% of diet DM) and formulated to have similar concentrations of energy and protein. The portion of feedstuffs that is potentially able to be consumed by humans is known as human edible. Accordingly, human-edible protein (HEP) and human-edible energy (HEE) inputs were calculated according to the recommended potential human-edible fraction of each dietary ingredient, and HEP and HEE outputs were determined as the amount of gross energy and true protein in the milk. Feed conversion efficiency (FCE) for HEP and HEE were expressed as output per input of each variable, whereas FCE for the production of fat-corrected milk (FCM) and energy-corrected milk (ECM) were expressed as the amount of each variable per DM intake. Results showed that substituting BP for grain did not affect DM intake, crude protein intake, or nutrient digestibility, whereas starch intake (5.70 vs. 7.43 kg/d for the low-BP vs. high-BP diets, respectively), HEP (2.34 and 1.92 kg/d), and HEE (186 and 147 MJ of gross energy/d) decreased. Treatments did not affect sorting and chewing activities, but increasing BP in the diet increased ruminal pH at 4 h after feeding (6.20 vs. 6.39) and milk fat content (2.92 vs. 3.15%). Similarly, FCE for ECM production (1.44 vs. 1.54) as well as FCE for HEE (0.653 vs. 0.851) and HEP (0.629 vs. 0.702) were greater in high-BP diets compared with low-BP diets. The interaction of BP and grain sources significantly affected FCE for ECM production, where improvements were more evident when BP was substituted for barley than for corn. The improvement in FCE for HEE was greater when BP was substituted for barley (0.236) rather than corn (0.161). In conclusion, the substitution of BP for barley or corn grains in high-concentrate diets of high-producing cows decreased starch intake, increased ruminal pH at 4 h after feeding, and improved FCE for FCM production. Substitution for barley, rather than for corn, promoted greater FCE for ECM production and HEE.',\n"," 'Highlights •13 barley microRNAs and 2 microRNAs* are nitrogen excess responsive.•Target mRNA levels are in agreement with the cognate microRNA level change.•Identified microRNAs and their targets respond in an opposite way in nitrogen deficiency conditions.•These microRNAs can be regarded as sensors of nitrogen homeostasis in barley plants.',\n"," 'Highlights •F. graminearum s.s. 15-ADON genotype was the major contaminant in barley samples.•The frequency of F. poae was high in barley samples from RS.•High levels of ENN B and ENN B1 were detected in samples from RS.•Co-contamination of BEA, DON, ENNs, NIV and ZEA was observed.•There were samples with DON and ZEA levels above the European and Brazilian regulations.',\n"," '@@@@Highlights •Microwave altered properties of isolated and in-kernel hull-less barley starches.•Disrupted crystalline region was greater in in-kernel starches.•Peak viscosity of in-kernel starches decreased as microwaving increased.•Amylose plays a profound role in the properties of microwaved starch.',\n"," '@@@@Highlights •Nutrient composition of highland barley was summarized.•Phychemical properties and potential nutritional functions of main ingredients in highland barley were reviewed.•Nutritional functions of whole-grain highland barley were revealed.•Future research trends were proposed.',\n"," 'Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) stands out for its high content on bioactive compounds although it is not frequently found in human food. In this study, a purple hulless barley genotype was used to explore its food potential. β-glucans, arabinoxylans, anthocyanins and other phenolic components were determined in biscuits containing different proportions of whole barley flour and pearling fractions and compared to biscuits prepared with 100% refined (control) and 100% whole wheat flour. Barley biscuits were richer in bioactive compounds, showed higher in-vitro antioxidant capacity and lower estimated glycemic index with slight changes in physical properties. Baking did not affect β-glucans and arabinoxylans while it increased most of the phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. Barley anthocyanins were thermally unstable and exhibited high degradation rates but were partially stabilized by tartaric acid. Biscuits baked with 100% flour from purple barley grains fulfill the health claim of “high in fiber”. A single biscuit provides more than 0.75g of β-glucans. Thus, one serving of four biscuits satisfies the 3g of β-glucans per day target to display the label of “reduces blood cholesterol and risk of heart disease”.',\n"," 'The influence of barley particle size and enzyme supplementation on performance, nutrient and energy utilization, and intestinal morphometry of broiler starters (day 1–21) fed pelleted barley-based diets was evaluated. Two barley particle sizes (fine and coarse) and 4 enzyme treatments (nonsupplemented [control], carbohydrase [0.15 g/kg of feed; Carb], phytase [0.10 g/kg; Phy] and combination of carbohydrase and phytase [0.15 and 0.10 g/kg, respectively; Carb + Phy]) were evaluated in a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement. Fine and coarse barley particles were achieved by grinding whole barley in a hammer mill to pass through 2.0 and 8.0 mm screens, respectively. A total of 384, 1-day-old male broilers (8 birds/cage; 6 cages/treatment) were used. Supplemental enzymes tended (P = 0.056) to increase the weight gain of birds with a synergetic effect from Carb + Phy. The response of feed intake to supplemental enzymes interacted (P < 0.05) with barley particle size, as Phy increased feed intake only in fine barley diets. Both coarse particles and supplemental Carb, either individually or in combination with Phy, reduced feed per gain (P P P P P P P P > 0.05) affected the jejunal digesta viscosity. In summary, feeding coarse barley particles and supplemental Carb improved the feed efficiency and nutrient and energy utilization.

The combination of Carb and Phy tended to improve the weight gain but caused no further improvements in nutrient utilization.',\n"," 'Adverse environmental conditions are major threats to cereal crop production. For crop improvement, it is crucial to know the molecular responses of cereals to abiotic stresses. Heat shock factors (HSF) not only regulate the stress responses but also the developmental processes of plants. In the present study, we performed a comprehensive investigation of barley HSF genes. A total of 23 genes were identified in the HvHSF gene family and classified into three characteristic classes on the basis of phylogenetic analysis. Stress response, hormone signaling, and development specific cis-regulatory elements co-existed in the promotor region of many HvHSF genes. The expression analysis showed expression of HvHSFs under major abiotic stresses in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. All the HSFs of class A showed response to heat shock except for A1 and A8.vHvHSFA1a, the only member of subclass A1 showed constitutive expression in all the selected tissues and conditions. Up-regulation of class B and C genes, suggests their putative role in drought stress, development and recovery post heat stress.

Endosperm cellularization commences at the maternal-filial intersection of grains and generates endosperm transfer cells (ETCs), a cell type with a prominent anatomy optimized for efficient nutrient transport. Barley HISTIDINE KINASE1 (HvHK1) was identified as a receptor component with spatially restricted expression in the syncytial endosperm where ETCs emerge. Here, we demonstrate its function in ETC fate acquisition using RNA interference-mediated downregulation of HvHK1. Repression of HvHK1 impairs cell specification in the central ETC region and the development of transfer cell morphology, and consecutively defects differentiation of adjacent endosperm tissues. Coinciding with reduced expression of HvHK1, disturbed cell plate formation and fusion were observed at the initiation of endosperm cellularization, revealing that HvHK1 triggers initial cytokinesis of ETCs. Cell-type-specific RNA sequencing confirmed loss of transfer cell identity, compromised cell wall biogenesis and reduced transport capacities in aberrant cells and elucidated two-component signaling and hormone pathways that are mediated by HvHK1. Gene regulatory network modeling was used to specify the direct targets of HvHK1; this predicted non-canonical auxin signaling elements as the main regulatory links governing cellularization of ETCs, potentially through interaction with type-B response regulators. This work provides clues to previously unknown molecular mechanisms directing ETC specification, a process with fundamental impact on grain yield in cereals. CAPTION(S): Data S1.

Here, the cell wall microstructure is investigated using (bio)chemical analyses, cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) as the main techniques. The relative proportions of [beta]-glucan, arabinoxylan and pectin in cell walls were 61, 34 and 5%, respectively. The average thickness of a single endosperm cell wall was 0.30 [micro]m, as estimated by the cryo-SEM analysis of barley seeds, which was reduced to 0.16 [micro]m after malting. After fluorescent staining, 3D confocal multiphoton microscopy (multiphoton CLSM) imaging revealed the complex cell wall architecture. The endosperm cell wall is composed of a structure in which arabinoxylan and pectin are colocalized on the outside, with [beta]-glucan depositions on the inside. During germination, arabinoxylan and [beta]-glucan are hydrolysed, but unlike [beta]-glucan, arabinoxylan remains present in defined cell walls in malt. Integrating the results, an enhanced model for the endosperm cell walls in barley is proposed. Article Note: These authors contributed equally to this work. CAPTION(S): Table S1.

In barley, there is evidence that changes in gene copy number underlie important agronomic traits. The recently released reference sequence of barley represents a valuable genomic resource for unveiling the incidence of CNVs that affect gene content and for identifying sequence features associated with CNV formation. Using exome sequencing and read count data, we detected 16 605 deletions and duplications that affect barley gene content by surveying a diverse panel of 172 cultivars, 171 landraces, 22 wild relatives and other 32 uncategorized domesticated accessions. The quest for segmental duplications (SDs) in the reference sequence revealed many low-copy repeats, most of which overlap predicted coding sequences. Statistical analyses revealed that the incidence of CNVs increases significantly in SD-rich regions, indicating that these sequence elements act as hot spots for the formation of CNVs. The present study delivers a comprehensive genome-wide study of CNVs affecting barley gene content and implicates SDs in the molecular mechanisms that lead to the formation of this class of CNVs.

To understand how the transient carbon is accumulated and utilized in response to cold, barley plants were grown in a combination of cold days and/or nights. Both daytime and night cold reduced growth. Sucrose was the main carbohydrate supplying growth at night, representing 50-60% of the carbon consumed. Under warm days and nights, starch was the second contributor with 26% and malate the third with 15%. Under cold nights, the contribution of starch was severely reduced, due to an inhibition of its synthesis, including under warm days, and malate was the second contributor to C requirements with 24-28% of the total amount of carbon consumed. We propose that malate plays a critical role as an alternative carbon source to sucrose and starch in barley. Hexoses, malate, and sucrose mobilization and starch accumulation were affected in barley elf3 clock mutants, suggesting a clock regulation of their metabolism, without affecting growth and photosynthesis however. Altogether, our data suggest that the mobilization of sucrose and malate and/or barley growth machinery are sensitive to cold. Article Note: Deceased October 2019.

Pearling had been proved to be an effective means in reducing enzyme content, and tempering could improve the sensitivity of enzymes to heat. Synergism of the two pre-treatment methods increased the inactivation of lipase and peroxidase in highland barley to 80% and 100%, respectively, and the optimal pre-treatment and roasting condition was P20M16T16 (20% pearling rate, 16% moisture, and 16 min treatment time) at 180 °C.

Coleoptile length is a key agronomic trait in cereal crops such as barley, as long coleoptiles are linked to drought tolerance and improved seedling establishment under early water-limited growing conditions. Results In this study, we detected large genetic variation in a panel of 328 diverse barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) accessions. To understand the overall genetic basis of barley coleoptile length, all accessions were germinated in the dark and phenotyped for coleoptile length after 2 weeks. The investigated barleys had significant variation for coleoptile length. We then conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) with more than 30,000 molecular markers and identified 8 genes and 12 intergenic loci significantly associated with coleoptile length in our barley panel. The Squamosa promoter-binding-like protein 3 gene (SPL3) on chromosome 6H was identified as a major candidate gene. The missense variant on the second exon changed serine to alanine in the conserved SBP domain, which likely impacted its DNA-binding activity.

During this period, intensive studies aimed at identification of barley genomic loci associated with economically important traits have been carried out; online databases and tools for working with barley genomic data and their deposition have appeared and are being replenished. In recent years, GWAS analysis has been used for large-scale phenotypegenotype association studies, which has been widely used in barley since 2010 due to the developed SNP-arrays, as well as genotyping methods based on direct NGS sequencing of selected fractions of the genome. To date, more than 80 papers have been published that describe the results of the GWAS analysis in barley. SNP identification associated with economically important traits and their transformation into CAPS or KASP markers convenient for screening selection material significantly expands the possibilities of marker-assisted selection of barley. In addition, the currently available information on potential target genes and the quality of the whole barley genome sequence provides a good base for applying genome editing technologies to create material for the creation of varieties with desired properties.',\n"," 'The study was designed to assess technological quality of grains from two wheat cultivars (Elixer and Rockefeller), as well as one cultivar of winter (Joy) and one cultivar of spring barley (Irina), and to carry out the malting process at temperature of 15°C for 5 days. Malt analyses were carried out in accordance with the ECB Methods. The wheat malts were found with lower Kolbach index, and high viscosity was identified in wort obtained from wheat. The findings related to the wheat malts showed better quality parameters in Elixer variety compared to Rockefeller variety. Elixer wheat malt had higher diastatic power (427.03 WK) and lower extractivity (81.85%) compared to Joy barley malt (376.12 WK and 85.79%). Laboratory tests assessing the malts and wort showed that winter barley grain has high malting quality and can be used without modifications in the malting and mashing processes in brewing industry. It is necessary to conduct further research focusing on cultivation, agricultural techniques and technologies applied in wheat farming, in order to obtain cultivars which can be used to produce high quality malts.',\n"," 'Results of mycotoxicological survey of representative samples of feed and procured wheat, barley, oat and maize grain batches are demonstrated. The samples were submitted by the Veterinary Service officials, livestock farmers and feed mill operators, agricultural producers, specialized commercial business operators and farm owners in seven Federal Districts of the Russian Federation in 2009-2019. Similar amounts of wheat and barley grain samples were received from the Central, Volga, Ural and Siberian Federal Districts. The amount of wheat samples delivered from the Southern Federal District prevailed over the number of barley samples, and the maize samples were mostly delivered from the regions of the Central Federal District. Fusarium toxins including T-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and fumonisins of group B as well as alternariol, ochratoxin A, citrinin, aflatoxin В1, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid, mycophenolic acid, ergot alkaloids and emodin were detected and measured according to the validated competitive ELISA procedure. Generalization of the results demonstrated domination of fusarium toxins and active involvement of alternariol in the contamination of all types of feed grains as well as high occurrence of emodin in ear cereals and increased occurrence of T-2 toxin and ochratoxin A in barley. Shift of medians and 90%-percentile of the basic contaminants to lower values as compared to mean and maximal ones was reported thus being indicative of their possible accumulation at the levels outside the typical range. The highest levels of T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol and ochratoxin A as well as 90%-percentile values exceeded the acceptable levels. The maize grains demonstrated the whole complex of the tested fusarium toxins with the prevalence of T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone and fumonisins; and the maximal amounts of these mycotoxins by several times exceeded the accepted regulatory levels. Diacetoxyscirpenol, aflatoxin В1, sterigmatocystin, cyclopiazonic acid and ergot alkaloids are classified as rare feed grain contaminants. High prevalence of alternariol and emodin known as “diarrhea factor” as well as maize grain contamination with mycophenolic acid (mycotoxin having an immunosuppressive effect) are for the first time reported in this paper. These data support the need of their introduction in the group of regulated substances significant for public health.

A total of 126 barley genotypes received from Hill Crops Research Program, Kabre, Dolakha having SoluUwa as a susceptible check and Bonus as a resistant check were evaluated as barley disease screening nursery (BDSN) under natural epiphytotic condition at National Maize Research Program, Rampur, Chitwan during winter seasons of 2017 and 2018. The nursery was planted in augmented design. The resistant and susceptible checks were repeated and planted after each 10 tested entries. The unit plot size was 2 rows of one meter length for each genotype planted continuously with 25cm row to row spacing. The seed rate was 100 kg/ha. The recommended fertilizer dose of 23:30:0 N:P2O5:K2O kg/ha was applied. The double digit scale (00 to 99) was used to measure overall foliar infection on the whole plant during flowering, soft dough and hard dough stages.

Evaluation of the naked barely genotypes for yield and disease is fundamental for their efficient utilization in plant breeding schemes and effective conservation programs. Therefore, to identify high yielding and yellow rust resistant landraces of naked barley for hilly and mountainous agro-ecosystem, twenty naked barley landraces collected from different locations of Nepal, were evaluated in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications during winter season of 2016 and 2017 at Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal. Combined analysis of variances revealed that NGRC04902 (3.46 t/ha), NGRC00886 (3.28 t/ha), NGRC02309 (3.21 t/ha) and NGRC06026 (3.10 t/ha) were the high yielding landraces and statistically at par with the released variety 'Solu Uwa' (3.15 t/ha).

These landraces having higher yield and better resistance to yellow rust need to be deployed to farmers' field to diversify the varietal options and used in resistant breeding program to improve the productivity of naked barley for Nepalese farmers.\",\n"," 'As a major abiotic stress, drought causes instability and deterioration of malt barley quality. There is distinct difference among barley cultivars in the responses of the main malt quality traits to drought stress. In the previous study, we identified some Tibetan wild barley accessions with relatively less change of malt quality traits under drought. In this study, we examined the impact of drought stress during grain filling stage on grain weight and several important malt quality traits, including total protein content, β-glucan content, limit dextrinase activity, β-amylase activity, and protein fractions in four barley genotypes (two Tibetan wild accessions and two cultivars). Drought treatment reduced grain weight, β-glucan content, and increased total protein content, β-amylase activity. These changes differed among barley genotypes and treatments, and are closely associated with grain filling process and kernel weight. All the results indicated Tibetan wild barley had great potential for developing drought tolerant barley cultivars. Relatively stable kernel weight or filling process under water stress should be highlighted in malt barley breeding in order to reduce the effect of water stress on malt barley quality.',\n"," 'Abundance, cheapness, biodegradability and non-toxic behaviour of starches attract many food and non-food industries. Starch provides viscosity, adhesion, texture and homogeneity to various food products. This review article deals with the chemical composition, structure, granular morphology, pasting, thermal and in vitro digestibility properties of barley starches. Significant variations were found in characteristics of starches from normal, waxy and high amylose barley cultivars suggesting their broader potential applications. Amylose content appears to be the major factor controlling almost all physicochemical properties of barley starch due to its influence on physico-chemical, functional, pasting and thermal properties. Morphological studies have reflected significant differences among barley starch granule shapes. Waxy barley starch granules composed of a mixture of large spherical, disc and lenticular shaped whereas normal and waxy starches showed small irregularly shaped starch granules. A characteristic of cereal starches, A-type crystallinity of barley starches were observed by X-ray diffractions. For barley starch, storage modulus (G′) value for starch pastes was reported to be more than loss modulus (G′′) and <1 value of tan δ (G′′/G′) of barley starch indicating their elastic behaviour than viscous.',\n"," 'Malting quality will be greatly deteriorated when barley plants suffer from post-anthesis drought stress, however there is a marked difference among barley genotypes in the responses of malting quality to drought stress, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the genotypic difference remain unclear. We made transcriptome and metabolome analysis on the developing grains of two barley genotypes differing in the responses to drought stress. Post-anthesis drought treatments led to decreased grain weight and β-glucan content, increased grain protein content and β-amylase activity. Drought stress enhanced H2O2 and heat-shock protein accumulation in the two barley genotypes, with the drought-tolerant genotype showing higher capacity of scavenging H2O2 and reducing misfolded protein accumulation than the drought-susceptible genotype. Moreover, the drought-tolerant genotype was more efficient in redistributing assimilates stored in the vegetative tissues into the developing grains. After re-watering to relieve drought stress, the drought-tolerant genotype can further modify auxin transport and ethylene signaling, enhancing redistribution of assimilates into grains. Transcriptome comparisons and weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) identified some key genes regulating the responses of malting quality traits to drought stress, such as RLK-LRR, β-glucosidase and HSP . In conclusion, less change of main malting quality traits in the drought-tolerant genotype under post-anthesis drought stress is attributed to its higher capacity of alleviating the stress injury through scavenging ROS and redistributing the metabolites stored in the vegetative organs into the developing grains.',\n"," 'Spontaneous mutation and natural selection pressure have contributed immensely to the genetic diversity of barley; a crop domesticated and grown since antiquity under diverse agro-ecological regions. Similarly, anthropogenic factors like cultural traditions and food preferences have also shaped the evolution of barley genetic diversity in the course of acclimatization under diverse ecosystems. Despite a rich genetic diversity, rapid depletion of barley genetic resources including the virtual extinction of several important landraces due to introduction of high yielding varieties and the loss of traditional farming systems remains a significant concern. Genetic gain in terms of higher grain yield and quality has obviously reduced the resilience of farmers’ varieties and landraces to environmental stresses; that could in fact be explored as an important source of genes and traits for improving barley adaptability to adverse agro-climatic conditions. Unfortunately, landraces are not being fully exploited in barley breeding programs mainly due to lack of inadequate information.

Sensitivity to short-day photoperiod is a desirable attribute for facultative types. In order to broaden our understanding of the genetics of these phenotypes, we mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and identified candidate genes using a genome-wide association studies (GWAS) panel composed of 882 barley accessions that was genotyped with the Illumina 9K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Fifteen loci including 5 known and 10 novel QTL/genes were identified for LTT—assessed as winter survival in 10 field tests and mapped using a GWAS meta-analysis. FR-H1, FR-H2, and FR-H3 were major drivers of LTT, and candidate genes were identified for FR-H3. The principal determinants of vernalization sensitivity were VRN-H1, VRN-H2, and PPD-H1. VRN-H2 deletions conferred insensitive or intermediate sensitivity to vernalization. A subset of accessions with maximum LTT were identified as a resource for allele mining and further characterization.

Increased gene copy number of the PAPhy_a gene expressed during seed development has augmented the MGPA in cereals like rye and wheat. PAPhy_a phytase is highly stable and a potent enzyme in feed. However, barley only contains one HvPAPhy_a gene and the MGPA levels needs to be increased to substitute for the addition of microbial phytases to the feed. A substantial increase in MGPA for cisgenic barley was achieved with one extra homozygous HvPAPhy_a insert when the plants were grown in the greenhouse. In the current study, the stability of increased MGPA was confirmed in open field grown cisgenic barley. Furthermore, the gene dose response of phytase cisgenes from three different cisgenic barley plants were horizontally stacked. Cisgenic barley with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 extra HvPAPhy_a inserts demonstrated a perfect positive linear correlation with the level of MGPA. The current study provides new insight into the potential of stacking of cisgenes in crops and suggests cisgene stacking as a versatile strategy for crop improvement.',\n"," 'Barley is the most common source for malt to be used in brewing beer and other alcoholic beverages. This involves converting the starch of barley into fermentable sugars a process that involves malting, that is germinating of the grains, and mashing, which is an enzymatic process. Numerous metabolic processes are involved in germination, where distinct and time-dependent alterations at the metabolite levels happen. In this study, 2,628 plots of 565 spring malting barley lines from Nordic Seed A/S were investigated. Phenotypic records were available for six malting quality (MQ) traits: filtering speed (FS), wort clearness (WCL), extract yield (EY), wort color (WCO), beta glucan (BG), and wort viscosity (WV). Each line had a set of dense genomic markers. In addition, 24,018 metabolomic features (MFs) were obtained for each sample from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra for wort samples produced from each experimental plot. The genetic variation in the MFs was investigated using a univariate model, and the relationship between MFs and the MQ traits was studied using a bivariate model. Results showed that a total of 8,604 MFs had heritability estimates significantly larger than 0 and for all MQ traits, there were genetic correlations with up to 86.77% and phenotypic correlations with up to 90.07% of the significant heritable MFs. In conclusion, around one third of all MFs were significantly heritable, among which a considerable proportion had significant additive genetic and/or phenotypic correlations with the MQ traits (WCO, WV, and BG) in spring barley. The results from this study indicate that many of the MFs are heritable and MFs have great potential to be used in breeding barley for high MQ.',\n"," 'Highlights •Grain size determination was strongly affected by environment.•PLSR modelling provided a fairly reliable prediction of plump grains fraction.•The main environmental drivers of plump grains determination were identified.•Our study lead to better crop management and assist malt industry in production planning.',\n"," 'In barley plants, water shortage causes many changes on the morphological, physiological and biochemical levels resulting in the reduction of grain yield. In the present study the results of various experiments on the response of the same barley recombinant inbred lines to water shortage, including phenotypic, proteomic and metabolomic traits were integrated. Obtained results suggest that by a multi-omic approach it is possible to indicate proteomic and metabolomic traits important for reaction of barley plants to reduced water availability. Analysis of regression of drought effect (DE) for grain weight per plant on DE of proteomic and metabolomic traits allowed us to suggest ideotype of barley plants tolerant to water shortage. It was shown that grain weight under drought was determined significantly by six proteins in leaves and five in roots, the function of which were connected with defence mechanisms, ion/electron transport, carbon (in leaves) and nitrogen (in roots) metabolism, and in leaves additionally by two proteins of unknown function. Out of numerous metabolites detected in roots only Aspartic and Glutamic acids and one metabolite of unknown function, were found to have significant influence on grain weight per plant. The role of these traits as biomarkers, and especially as suggested targets of ideotype breeding, has to be further studied.

In this study, we performed the analyses of multi-root-omes (transcriptomes, metabolomes, and lipidomes) of a domesticated barley cultivar (Clipper) and a landrace (Sahara) that maintain and restrict seedling root growth under salt stress, respectively. Novel generalized linear models were designed to determine differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and abundant metabolites (DAMs) specific to salt treatments, genotypes, or rootzones (meristematic Z1, elongation Z2, and maturation Z3). Based on pathway over-representation of the DEGs and DAMs, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis is the most statistically enriched biological pathway among all salinity responses observed. Together with histological evidence, an intense salt-induced lignin impregnation was found only at stelic cell wall of Clipper Z2, compared with a unique elevation of suberin deposition across Sahara Z2. This suggests two differential salt-induced modulations of apoplastic flow between the genotypes. Based on the global correlation network of the DEGs and DAMs, callose deposition that potentially adjusted symplastic flow in roots was almost independent of salinity in rootzones of Clipper, and was markedly decreased in Sahara. Taken together, we propose two distinctive salt tolerance mechanisms in Clipper (growth-sustaining) and Sahara (salt-shielding), providing important clues for improving crop plasticity to cope with deteriorating global soil salinization.',\n"," '@@@@Highlights •Waxy barleys genotypes showed higher β-glucans content, lower starch amount and higher viscosity than normal genotypes.•Waxy barley is an interesting and suitable cereal for the enrichment of bioactive compounds.•β-Glucans enriched flour by air classification could be a good ingredient for functional foods preparation.',\n"," 'In the present study we examined the effect of seeds of the weed Silybum marianum (L.)

In eukaryotes, RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of RNA metabolism that includes synthesis, processing, editing, modifying, transport, storage and stability of RNA. In plants, the family of RBPs is vastly expanded compared to other eukaryotes including humans. In this study we identified 363 RBPs in the barley genome. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of barley RBPs indicated these proteins were in all the major cellular compartments and associated with key biological processes including translation, splicing, seed development and stress signaling. Members with the classical RNA binding motifs such as the RNA recognition motif (RRM), KH domain, Helicase, CRM, dsRNA and Pumilio were identified in the repertoire of barley RBPs. Similar to Arabidopsis, the RRM containing RBPs were the most abundant in barley genome. In-depth analysis of the RRM containing proteins - polyA binding proteins, Ser/Arg rich proteins and Glycine-rich RBPs were undertaken. Reanalysis of the proteome dataset of various stages during barley malting identified 38 RBPs suggesting an important role for these proteins during the malting process. This survey provides a systematic analysis of barley RBPs and serves as the basis for the further functional characterization of this important family of proteins.',\n"," 'Abstract In‐crop soil waterlogging can be caused by extreme rainfall events, high ground water tables, excessive irrigation, lateral ground water flow, either individually or in concert, and together these factors inhibit potential grain yields. However, the extent to which yield is influenced by the timing and duration of waterlogging relative to crop phenology is unknown. To investigate this, we conducted a range of waterlogging treatments on modern barley genotypes differing in their waterlogging tolerance, with tolerance conferred through aerenchyma formation under oxygen deficit conditions. Experiment 1 was conducted in a controlled environment using four waterlogging treatments: waterlogging at Zadoks stage (ZS) 12.5 for 1 or 2 months (WL1 and WL2, respectively), waterlogging at ZS 15 for 2 months (WL3), and waterlogging initiated 1 day before heading for 15 days (WL4). Experiment 2 was conducted in the field with WL2. Averaged across experiments, yield was reduced by 35% in W1 to 52% in WL3 due to fewer spikes/m2 and kernels/spike. WL4 had the greatest impact on yield (70% reduction) due to its effect on spikelet fertility and grain filling. Phenology was delayed 1–8 ZS at the end of waterlogging treatments, with the waterlogging‐susceptible cultivar Franklin showing the greatest delays, and waterlogging tolerant genotypes (Macquarie+, TAMF169) capable of aerenchyma formation under waterlogging having the least delays (0–4 ZS). Genotypes with aerenchyma formation QTL (Macquarie+) showed nonsignificant yield reduction compared with nonwaterlogged controls, preventing 23% yield loss under early phenological waterlogging stress. Late growth stage waterlogging substantially reduced average final grain yield by 70%.',\n"," 'Wild barley Hordeum spontaneum (WB) is the progenitor of a cultivated barley Hordeum vulgare (CB). Understanding efficient mechanisms evolved by WB to cope with abiotic stresses may open prospects of transferring these promising traits to the high yielding CB genotypes. This study aimed to investigate the strategies that WB plants utilise in regard to the control of stomatal operation and ionic homeostasis to deal with salinity stress, one of the major threats to the global food security. Twenty-six genotypes of WB and CB were grown under glasshouse conditions and exposed to 300 mM NaCl salinity treatment for 5 weeks followed by their comprehensive physiological assessment. WB had higher relative biomass than CB when exposed to salinity stress. Under saline conditions, WB plants were able to keep constant stomatal density (SD) while SD significantly decreased in CB. The higher SD in WB also resulted in a higher stomatal conductance (gs) under saline conditions, with gs reduction being 51% and 72% in WB and CB, respectively. Furthermore, WB showed faster stomatal response to light, indicating their better ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experiments with isolated epidermal strips indicated that CB genotypes have the higher stomatal aperture when incubated in 80 mM KCl solution, and its aperture declined when KCl was substituted by NaCl. On the contrary, WB genotype had the highest stomatal aperture being exposed to 80 mM NaCl suggesting that WB plants may use Na+ instead of K+ for stomata movements. Overall, our data suggest that CB employ a stress-escaping strategy by reducing stomata density, to conserve water, when grown under salinity conditions. WB, on a contrary, is capable of maintaining relatively constant stomata density, faster stomatal movement and higher gs under saline conditions.',\n"," '1.

Soil salinity can lead to Na.sup.+ toxicity of plant cells, influencing the uptake and retention of other important ions [i.e. potassium (K.sup.+)] required for growth. However, measuring and quantifying soluble ions in their native, cellular environment is inherently difficult. Technologies that allow in situ profiling of plant tissues are fundamental for our understanding of abiotic stress responses and the development of tolerant crops. Here, we employ laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to quantify Na, K and other elements [calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulphur (S), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe)] at high spatial resolution in the root growth zone of two genotypes of barley (Hordeum vulgare) that differ in salt-tolerance, cv. Clipper (tolerant) and Sahara (sensitive). The data show that Na.sup.+ was excluded from the meristem and cell division zone, indicating that Na.sup.+ toxicity is not directly reducing cell division in the salt-sensitive genotype, Sahara. Interestingly, in both genotypes, K.sup.+ was strongly correlated with Na.sup.+ concentration, in response to salt stress. In addition, we also show important genetic differences and salt-specific changes in elemental composition in the root growth zone. These results show that LA-ICP-MS can be used for fine mapping of soluble ions (i.e. Na.sup.+ and K.sup.+) in plant tissues, providing insight into the link between Na.sup.+ toxicity and root growth responses to salt stress.

The rising air temperatures also increase the evapotranspiration demands of the environment and increase the frequency and length of heatwaves, which is a stress factor for plants. Using the GIS procedures, we identified the areas of significant abiotic risks occurring during the critical growth stages of spring barley (high air temperatures at the time of tillering and lack of soil moisture from the beginning of flowering to yellow ripening) with potential impact on grain yield in the Czech Republic. Unique datasets, including i) meteorological data, ii) phenological data, iii) pedological data, iv) land-use data, and v) geographic data, have been integrated and analysed using the sophisticated ArcGIS software environment. The method used in this study is universally applicable and allows comparisons at the local, regional, and supra-regional levels. The identification of risk areas will allow for a) finding tolerant varieties from problematic areas, b) locating the use of these varieties in risk areas and c) recommending and implementing adequate farming practices to reduce the impact of risk abiotic stressors on spring barley under current climate conditions. This will allow accurate estimation of weather impacts on spring barley grain yield in a particular year and precise application of countermeasures leading to reduced negative impacts on yield and the quality of spring barley production.

Materials and methods: the research was carried out in Aksay district Rostov region on the experimental field of the Federal State Budgetary Scientific Institution “Federal Rostov Agrarian Scientific Center”. The object of research is productivity and protein content in spring barley grain cultivated in the crop rotation peas – winter wheat – spring barley. The trial establishment, inventory and mathematical processing of the obtained data were carried out according to the methodology of the field experiment by B. A. Dospekhov. The determination of the hydrothermal coefficient was carried out according to the method by G. T. Selyaninov. Results. As a result of the studies, a strong positive relationship between the value of the obtained yield and fertilizer application was found. The correlation coefficient for years of research ranged from 0.70 to 0.88. It has been found that, regardless of the moisture supply, spring barley seeding form the highest yield when full fertilizer N30P60K150 is applied. The maximum protein content in the grain of the studied culture in hyperarid years was formed with the application of N30P60 (averaging 13.4 %), in dry years in variety N30 (11.9 %), and in slightly arid years with the application of P60 (11.4 %). The correlation and regression analysis showed the presence of an average and strong negative relationship between the hydrothermal coefficient, the total precipitation during the growing season and the protein content in barley grain. Conclusions: under the conditions of Priazov zone of Rostov region, the application of fertilizers helps to reduce the negative effect of the hydrothermal conditions of the growing season, which is especially important in years with insufficient rainfall and high air temperature and to ensure the formation of the maximum possible yield under the given conditions.

The plots were fertilized with 10 kg/da nitrogen and 6 kg/da phosphorus (P2O5). During the study the data on plant height, spike length, number of grain per spike and weight of grain per spike were collected. Results showed that average plant height was 72.10 cm in the control and ranged from 55.19 to 70.22 cm in M2 generation. Spike length ranged from 7.43 to 9.13 cm in M2 generation and was 8.71 cm in the control plants.

New solutions are required to solve this problem, and crop breeding for high nitrogen use efficiency or tolerance of low nitrogen availability has been widely considered to be a promising approach. However, the molecular mechanisms of high nitrogen use efficiency or low-nitrogen tolerance in crop plants are still to be elucidated, including the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Results In this study, we identified 498 lncRNAs in barley (Hordeum vulgare) landrace B968 (Liuzhutouzidamai), of which 487 were novel, and characterised 56 that were responsive to low-nitrogen stress. For functional analysis of differentially-expressed lncRNAs, the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment of co-expressed and co-located protein-coding genes were analyzed, and interactions with annotated co-expressed protein coding genes or micro RNAs (miRNAs) were further predicted. Target mimicry prediction between differentially-expressed lncRNAs and miRNAs identified 40 putative target mimics of lncRNAs and 58 target miRNAs. Six differentially-expressed lncRNAs were further validated by qPCR, and one in particular showed consistent differential expression using both techniques. Expression levels of most of the lncRNAs were found to be very low, and this may be the reason for the apparent inconsistency between RNA-seq and qPCR data. Conclusions The analysis of lncRNAs that are differentially-expressed under low-nitrogen stress, as well as their co-expressed or co-located protein coding genes and target mimics, could elucidate complex and hitherto uncharacterised mechanisms involved in the adaptation to low-nitrogen stress in barley and other crop plants.',\n"," 'In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), lateral branches called tillers contribute to grain yield and define shoot architecture, but genetic control of tiller number and developmental rate are not well characterized. The primary objectives of this work were to examine relationships between tiller number and other agronomic and morphological traits and identify natural genetic variation associated with tiller number and rate, and related traits. We grew 768 lines from the USDA National Small Grain Collection in the field and collected data over two years for tiller number and rate, and agronomic and morphological traits. Our results confirmed that spike row-type and days to heading are correlated with tiller number, and as much as 28% of tiller number variance was associated with these traits. In addition, negative correlations between tiller number and leaf width and stem diameter were observed, indicating trade-offs between tiller development and other vegetative growth. Thirty-three quantitative trait loci (QTL) were associated with tiller number or rate. Of these, 40% overlapped QTL associated with days to heading and 22% overlapped QTL associated with spike row-type, further supporting that tiller development is associated with these traits. Some QTL associated with tiller number or rate, including the major QTL on chromosome 3H, were not associated with other traits, suggesting that some QTL may be directly related to rate of tiller development or axillary bud number.

The second generation (М2) was sown by individual families (the family of the offspring of one М1 spike). Throughout the growing season the plants that differed from the original variety were selected, the families with chlorophyll mutations, with visible morphological and physiological changes were distinguished. In the third generation, the inheritance of altered traits in plants was tested. After harvesting the М1, М2, and М3 plants, they were analyzed by the elements of the productivity structure, comparing them with the initial form. It was found that the treatment of seeds with laser red light (LRL) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) pro-motes the formation in М1 of a tall plant with a long loose spike and a grain weight from an ear that exceeds the control indices. The frequency of chlorophyll changes in М2 ranged from 0.78% (K2CO3 0.1 + LRL) to 5.61% (K2CO3 0.1 n). The maximum frequency of families (12.15%) with morphophysio-logical changes was noted during seed treatment with potassium carbonate. The minimum value of this indicator was noted in the LRL + K2CO3 variant – 2.71%.

In this study, the genetic control of the nodal-root architectural and anatomical response to water deficit were investigated among diverse spring barley accessions. Water deficit induced substantial variations in the nodal root traits. The cortical, stele, and total root cross-sectional areas of the main-shoot nodal roots decreased under water deficit, but increased in the tiller nodal roots. Root xylem density and arrested nodal roots increased under water deficit, with the formation of root suberization/lignification and large cortical aerenchyma. Genome-wide association study implicated 11 QTL intervals in the architectural and anatomical nodal root response to water deficit. Among them, three and four QTL intervals had strong effects across seasons and on both root architectural and anatomical traits, respectively. Genome-wide epistasis analysis revealed 44 epistatically interacting SNP loci. Further analyses showed that these QTL intervals contain important candidate genes, including ZIFL2, MATE, and PPIB, whose functions are shown to be related to the root adaptive response to water deprivation in plants. These results give novel insight into the genetic architectures of barley nodal root response to soil water deficit stress in the fields, and thus offer useful resources for root-targeted marker-assisted selection.

In this study, expression of two DREB/CBF genes, TaDREB3 and TaCBF5L, was modulated in transgenic wheat and barley, by using stress-responsive promoters HDZI-3 and HDZI-4. The promoters were derived from the durum wheat genes encoding the [gamma]-clade TFs of the HD-Zip class I subfamily. The activities of tested promoters were induced by drought and cold in leaves of both transgenic species. Differences in sensitivity of promoters to drought strength were dependent on drought tolerance levels of cultivars used for generation of transgenic lines. Expression of the DREB/CBF genes under both promoters improved drought and frost tolerance of transgenic barley, and frost tolerance of transgenic wheat seedlings. Expression levels of the putative TaCBF5L downstream genes in leaves of transgenic wheat seedlings were up-regulated under severe drought, and up- or down-regulated under frost, compared to those of control seedlings. The application of TaCBF5L driven by the HDZI-4 promoter led to the significant increase of the grain yield of transgenic wheat, compared to that of the control wild-type plants, when severe drought was applied during flowering; although no yield improvements were observed when plants grew under well-watered conditions or moderate drought. Our findings suggest that the studied HDZI promoters combined with the DREB/CBF factors could be used in transgenic cereal plants for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance, and the reduction of negative influence of transgenes on plant development and grain yields.

The results showed that untreated highland barley gels formed a wider linear viscoelastic region (LVE) than hydrothermal-treated gels, and the storage moduli (G′) & loss moduli (G″) decrease as the hydrothermal treatment time increased. In particular, the LAOS behavior of highland barley gels in strain sweep was changed from Type Ⅳ strong strain overshoot to Type Ⅰ strain thinning by hydrothermal treatment. The frequency dependence of the viscoelastic moduli (G'∝ω0.41−0.74 and G''∝·ω0.41−0.77) for hydrothermal gels was classified as an entangled network. The creep behavior fitted well with a four-element Burgers model (R2>0.93). Moreover, after 10 min treatment, hydrothermal treatment had changed the gels from elastic-dominated to viscous-dominated, and the strain-stiffening/shear-thinning properties of highland barley gels also increased.\",\n"," 'Barley starch was dual modified by hydroxypropylation using 8% and 12% propylene oxide, separately, based on starch weight (dry basis) followed by cross-linking through addition of 1% mixture of sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) and sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) to form 8HPCL and 12HPCL E1442 (hydroxypropylated-distarch phosphate) barley starches, respectively. These modified starches were incorporated at 5% and 8% levels in soups. Functional characteristics of starches like swelling power, solubility and water retention capacity greatly improved after dual modifications. Paste clarity increased fivefold in case of 12HPCL (starch prepared using 12% propylene oxide and 1% mixture of STMP and STPP) modified barley starch. Higher level of hydroxypropylation also declined the retrogradation process in starches. All soups demonstrated thixotropic behaviour with flow behaviour indices less than one. Soup [S-(8HPCL)8] made with addition of 8% (8HPCL) barley starch demonstrated highest linear viscoelastic region (LVR), yield stress (τy) and complex viscosity (Ƞ⁎). Lowest value of tan δ (0.09) was also observed for S-(8HPCL)8 soup, suggesting its higher consistency. Native barley starch when added to soup at a level of 5% was the least acceptable in terms of sensory characteristics.',\n"," ...]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":365}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sLtFY7posYyb"},"source":["Clearly some text have a very bad beggining like @@@@Highlights • "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XxT6BveHseoW"},"source":["# Ponctuation"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"joFj0gD4eidP","executionInfo":{"elapsed":306,"status":"ok","timestamp":1625826292580,"user":{"displayName":"Emir ERGUN","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjYkGZ9MazJ5i5rNHlNSqhlNQ_hS2ARdeWpsa6_hg=s64","userId":"00940768551953047274"},"user_tz":-120},"outputId":"f6a8c1e0-7bfa-4aa0-bcca-692e68bd0bfb"},"source":["import re\n","import string\n","print(string.punctuation)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1EfnXLqVeYZJ"},"source":["def remove_punctuation(text):\n","    text = ''.join([char for char in text if char not in string.punctuation])\n","    #

participation in extension programs perceptions of sustainable agriculture and the feasibility of SAPs were significant factors in farmers adoption of sustainable agriculture practices Also consistent with the theory of planned behavior TPB all its dimensions attitude subjective norms and perceived behavioral control affected the adoption of SAPs This finding highlights the importance of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in promoting sustainable agricultural practice among banana production farmers This is the first study which attempts to provide empirical evidence using a

arsenic can result in adverse health effects for humans Gardeners may face exposure to these contaminants because of their regular contact with soil and consumption of produce grown in urban areas However there is a lack of research regarding whether differential exposure to HMM may be attributed to differential knowledge of exposure sources In industrial slag and hazardous levels of soil contamination were detected in West Atlanta We conducted communityengaged research through surveys and followup interviews to understand awareness of slag HMM in soil and potential remediation options Home gardeners were more likely to recognize HMM health effects and to cite health as a significant benefit of gardening than community gardeners In terms of knowledge participants were concerned about the potential health effects of contaminants in soil yet unconcerned with produce in their gardens Gardeners knowledge on sources of HMM exposure and methods for remediation were low and varied

recycling are failing to minimise waste in cities With urban populations growing worldwide there is the challenge of increased pressure to import food from rural areas Urban agriculture not only presents an opportunity to explore other means of sustainable food production but for managing organic waste in cities However this opportunity is not taken advantage of Besides there is a challenge of mixed reactions from urban planners and policymakers concerning the challenges and benefits presented by using organic waste in urban agriculture The current paper explores the perceived challenges and opportunities for organic waste utilisation and management through urban agriculture in the Durban South Basin in eThekwini Municipality in KwaZuluNatal KZN Province of South Africa It is anticipated that this information will be of use to the eThekwini Municipality policymakers researchers urban agriculture initiatives households and relevant stakeholders in the study areas and similar contexts globally Two hundred households involved in any urban farming activity and ten key informants six staff from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit of the eThekwini Municipality and four from the urban agricultural initiative were selected using convenient sampling Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse data The significant perceived challenges and risks associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture included lack of a supporting policy climatic variation lack of land tenure rights soil contamination and food safety concerns Qualitative data further showed that the difficulty in segregating waste water scarcity difficulty in accessing inputs limited transportation of organic waste inadequate handling and treatment of organic waste and being a health hazard were some important challenges On the other hand the significant perceived benefits associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture were enhanced food and nutrition security and opportunities for business incubation Other important benefits established through qualitative data were an improved market expansion for farmers and improved productivity Overall despite the perceived challenges and risks there is an opportunity to manage organic waste through urban agriculture It is imperative for an integrated policy encompassing the food climate and waste management to be developed to support this strategy All stakeholdersthe government municipal authorities and urban agricultural initiatives should also guided by the policy support urban farmers for example through pieces of training on how to properly manage and recycle organic waste land distribution inputs availability and water usage rights among other

applications Dermal uptake is a known exposure route for dichlorvos and chemical protective gloves are commonly utilized Chemical handling and application may occur in a variety of thermal environments and the rates of both chemical permeation through gloves and transdermal penetration may vary significantly with temperature There has been no published research on the temperaturedependent kinetics of these processes for dichlorvos and thus this study reports on the effects of hot conditions for the concentrated and application strength chemical Dichlorvos breakthrough times for nondisposable polyvinyl chloride PVC gloves at C were approximately halved compared to C for the concentrate vs h and more than halved at application strength vs h From permeation experiments covering  C there was a fold increase in cumulative permeation over h for the concentrated dichlorvos and the estimated activation energy halved Elevated temperature was also shown to be a significant factor for human skin penetration increasing the cumulative penetration of concentrate dichlorvos from  to  gcm p and application strength from  to  gcm p This work

However the identity functions and the factors that influence the association of bacterial endophytes with desert plants are poorly known These bacterial endophytes can be used as an untapped resource to favor plant growth and development in agroecosystems of arid regions The present study is therefore focused on the isolation and identification of bacterial endophytes from two native medicinal plants Fagonia mollis Delile and Achillea fragrantissima Forssk Sch Bip growing spontaneously in the arid region of the South Sinai Egypt and characterization of their plant growth promoting PGP traits Thirteen putative bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaves of both plant species and characterized for their plant growth promoting abilities using molecular and biochemical approaches as well as greenhouse trials Selected endophytic bacterial strains were applied to maize plants Zea mays L var Single cross Pioneer K to further evaluate their PGP abilities under greenhouse conditions Isolated bacterial strains have variable plant growth promoting activities Among these activities isolated bacterial endophytes have the efficacy of phosphate solubilizing with clear zones ranging from  to  mm Additionally the obtained bacterial endophytes increased the productivity of indole acetic acid IAA in broth media from to gmL with increasing tryptophan concentration from to mgmL Bacillus and Brevibacillus strains were frequently isolated from the leaves of both plant species and had significant positive effects on plant growth and shoot phosphorus P and nitrogen

majority of those transmitted by aphids to the predominance of whiteflytransmitted ones Later due to the shift towards an integrated control that has been quite successful in the control of aleyrodids not so much in the control of aphids aphidborne viruses are having a significant revival in open field cultivation Another threat is the continuous emergence of new species or variants of mechanically transmitted viruses Thus the number of viruses affecting these crops is constantly increasing and their control demands dynamic actions The main measures that have managed to limit the damage of these diseases have been the improvement in the physical barriers that limit the spread of vectors and the introduction of resistances in the germplasm Recently the increased movement of plant materials and of people the popularity of growing local crop varieties that lack natural resistances against pathogens and the prospects of global climate change may well have boosted the frequency of diseases and

machinery operators against risky slopes However machinery users manuals and road signs report information regarding slope steepness in two different ways by using the tilt angle in degrees and the slope percentage respectively In this study we investigated the comprehension of safety signs depicting critical slopes either in degrees or as percent values in a group of Italian agricultural machinery operators while considering the possible influence of previous experience with agricultural machinery previous incidents and onfarm occupation Eighteen tractor and selfpropelled machinery operators were administered graphical representations of seven slope angles in a randomized order and then were asked to estimate the slope steepness as both a tilt angle and a slope percentage The participants tended to overestimate slope steepness in degrees whereas the opposite was true for percentages Farmers who were previously involved in a machineryrelated incident were more accurate in their estimates The present results raise some considerations regarding the need to redesign safety communication and to promote targeted training interventions View FullText',\n"," 'Autonomous mowers are becoming increasingly common in public and private greenspaces Autonomous mowers can provide several advantages since these machines help to save time and energy and prevent operators from possible injuries Current autonomous mowers operate by following random trajectories within areas defined by a shallowburied boundary wire that has the purpose to generate an electromagnetic field Once the electromagnetic field is perceived by the autonomous mower the machine will stop and change direction Mowing along random trajectories is considered an efficient solution to manage areas with a variable number of obstacles In agriculture autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly popular since they can help to increase both the quantity and quality of agricultural products by reducing productive cost and improving the production process Thus even autonomous mowers may be useful to carry out some of the agricultural operations that are highly time consuming In fact some autonomous mowers designed and realized to work in vineyards and home vegetable gardens are already available on the market The aim of this study was to compare the work capacity of six autonomous mowers that move along random trajectories in areas with a high number of obstacles to assess if these machines may be employed in some agricultural contexts The six autonomous mowers were split in three groups based on their size large medium and small and were left to work in two areas with equal number of obstacles but different layouts The first area Site A had a square shape and an extension of m in order to keep the autonomous mowers enclosed inside it The second area Site B had a square shape and an extension of m in order to have a part of the area with no obstacles The layout and the size of the two areas affected the autonomous mowers performances in different ways The six autonomous mowers working on Site A obtained similar results and higher performances compared to the same mowers working on Site B All the autonomous mowers proved to be able to mow more than of Site A after h and more than of Site A after h On Site B small size autonomous mowers obtained the best results mowing more than of the area with obstacles after h and more than of the area with obstacles after h However specific work settings allowed larger autonomous mowers to improve their

The improved temporal spatial and spectral resolution of the European Space Agency ESA launched Sentinel A B twin platform is paving the way to their popularization in precision agriculture Besides the Sentinel A B constellation technical features the openaccess nature of the information they generate and the available support software are a significant improvement for agricultural monitoring This paper was motivated by the challenges faced by researchers and agrarian institutions entering this field it aims to frame remote sensing principles and Sentinel applications in agriculture Thus we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel in precision agriculture including abiotic and biotic stress detection and agricultural management We also compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that are relevant for agriculture to the Sentinel A B constellation features Contrasted with previous satellite image systems the Sentinel A B twin platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural monitoring and crop management worldwide Regarding crop stress monitoring Sentinel capacities for abiotic and biotic stresses detection

agricultural products on a daily basis is approximately less likely to disagree with the claim that organic products are healthier than nonorganic compared to a consumer who purchases organic products several times a week or month However as these benefits cannot be empirically confirmed green consumers look for official labels on the product packaging In order to assure the product quality more than half of them find out very important information about producers whether they have a product quality certificate how many years they are engaged in production and whether they have specific

efficient use of rainwater is critical for the improvement of sustainable crop production Conservation agriculture CA has been regarded as an ideal field management strategy to profoundly benefit water use and therefore crop production However it remains unclear as to how crop production and water use respond to annual precipitation and how CA practices affect crop production through regulating water use In this study a metaanalysis based on field observations was conducted to investigate the relationship between water use and crop production The results showed that annual precipitation of mm yr is a threshold to ensure relatively high crop production and water use efficiency WUE and mm yr is the most favorable rainfall level for crop production and WUE Evapotranspiration ET was linearly related to annual precipitation except that it was not the lowest when annual rainfall mm yr Although straw mulching is more important than tillage reduction tillage reduction is still necessary to combine with straw mulching to obtain a higher production of crop Crop production ET and WUE kept increasing as experimental duration increased indicating that extending CA term is essential to further improve water use and crop production We further proposed mathematical equations to prove that the increase in transpiration plays a critical role in water use and crop production improvement WUE is not necessarily related to the increase in yield and therefore higher transpiration rather than increased WUE should be the target for crop production improvement The results also suggest that evaporation and transpiration are not presented separately which limits investigation of the effective use of water by identifying transpiration Overall annual precipitation is essential for the levels of crop production ET and WUE on the Chinese Loess Plateau Reasonable CA practices especially longterm application could improve water use and crop

implementation The main obstacle is that a large part of the water used in agriculture is unmetered The objective of this study is to assess the Water Authorities WAs choices between different options of incentive pricing policies IPP and to evaluate their economic performance compared with flat rate FR solutions The applied method relies on a principalagent model under adverse selection in which WAs are less informed than farmers about the water use costs and profits In this respect the paper provides a theoretical interpretation of how different information conditions profit and cost structures contribute to affecting WAs pricing strategies and their ability to deal with some of the WFD principles The study shows that in the absence of water metering WAs can still set up incentive pricing strategies by formulating menus of contracts that are more efficient than flat rate payments Also we show that at least for cases in which there is only a small differentiation in water costs among farmers or no transaction costs the firstbest solution the solution that yields the highest return from the use of the resource can also be optimal under asymmetric information The main policy recommendation is that in the absence of water metering a wider set of incentive pricing options should be considered the performance of which however should be evaluated based on the specificities of each irrigated region View FullText',\n"," 'Discussions on food security in the Global North have raised questions about the capacity of periurban organic agriculture to provide sufficient healthy

integrated grazing farm optimisation and resource allocation model AgInform that departs from the use of whole farm and average data to the integration of biological data obtained directly from each of the land units within the farm The model allows the exploration of the dynamics of biophysical and financial performance of the farm in a steadystate singleyear approach where the opening and closing values of the biological elements of the farm system conditions must remain the same eg animal numbers herbage mass unless otherwise specified The user supplies pasture growth rates minimum and maximum acceptable pasture masses for each land management unit LMU differential boundary conditions to deliver defined environmental outcomes animal performance sheep beef and deer farm costs and market prices The linear programming LP equations formed by AgInform can be divided into a single objective and constraints which accommodate the boundaries including those placed on individual LMUs The optimization routine uses this information to identify the mix of livestock production enterprises that maximises profit for the business The model in maintaining the link between available pasture mass and livestock requirements for each LMU throughout all calculations enables the livestock type and number carried along with the pasture mass required on each LMU throughout the year to achieve the required animal performance levels to be included as model outputs A hill land sheep and beef farm consisting of seven distinct LMUs was used as a farmlevel case to assess if AgInform has

study aims to assess the protection for Vietnamese agriculture under trade liberalization based on the inputoutput approach From a theoretical perspective the authors develop a general framework to estimate the effective rate of protection using an inputoutput table taking into account tariffs subsidies and valueadded tax Based on the data of and with a projection to the empirical results reveal that agricultural production which is considered as Vietnams comparative advantage is insignificantly protected From the year to the effective rate of protection declined for primary agriculture and its supporting sectors and would become negative by This implies that Vietnamese farmers are at a disadvantage due to the effect of trade liberalization Furthermore it is empirically revealed that the primary agricultural sector has a high valueadded multiplier which means a significant contribution to the domestic economy is not protected by the governments tax and tariff policies Based on the study results the authors suggest some policy recommendations to improve the situation which are focused on the reduction of the valueadded tax rate on inputs while making industries with a high

living entities which has driven the evolution of biochemical processes to cope with stressed environmental and ecological conditions As climate change conditions continue to develop we anticipate more frequent occurrences of abiotic stresses such as drought high temperature and salinity Living plants which are sessile beings are more exposed to environmental extremes However plants are equipped with biosynthetic machinery operating to supply thousands of biocompounds required for maintaining internal homeostasis In addition to chemical coordination within a plant these compounds have the potential to assist plants in tolerating resisting and escaping biotic and abiotic stresses generated by the external environment Among certain biosynthates flavonoids are an important example of these stress mitigators Flavonoids are secondary metabolites and biostimulants they play a key role in plant growth by inducing resistance against certain biotic and abiotic stresses In addition the function of flavonoids as signal compounds to communicate with rhizosphere microbes is indispensable In this review the significance of flavonoids as biostimulants stress mitigators

food insecurity Drought causes oxidative stress on plants arising from excessive production of reactive oxygen species ROS due to inadequate CO which disrupts the photosynthetic machinery of plants The use of conventional methods for the development of droughttolerant crops is timeconsuming and the full adoption of modern biotechnology for crop enhancement is still regarded with prudence Plant growthpromoting rhizobacteria PGPR could be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach for enhancing crop growth under environmental stress The various direct and indirect mechanisms used for plant growth enhancement by PGPR were discussed Synthesis of aminocyclopropanecarboxylate ACC deaminase enhances plant nutrient uptake by breaking down plant ACC thereby preventing ethylene accumulation and enable plants to tolerate water stress The exopolysaccharides produced also improves the ability of the soil to withhold water PGPR enhances osmolyte production which is effective in

synchronization with a mounting food insecurity Our research aims therefore to identify the main constraints for the expansion of UA in Benin and adopt a threepronged approach combined with a systematic literature review a survey held among experienced urban gardeners and indepth interviews with stakeholders Altogether the synthesis shows a predominance of five main constraints lack of land and tenure insecurity insufficient government support restricted market access limited access to productive factors and inequality issues Specifically while the review showed that most barriers are linked and could be tackled together the survey indicated a political unwillingness which in our indepth interviews is explained by the unperceived benefits of investing in UA and the lack of

Bacillus cereus strain P accession no MF The foliar spray of SA mgL was applied on days old seedlings The combined treatment of the consortium of PGPR and SA not only alleviated the adverse effects of low moisture stress of soil in rainfed area but also resulted in significant accumulation of leaf chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence and and carotenoids and in the shoot of both the varieties The PGPR inoculation significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and and decreased the proline content and antioxidant enzymes activities and as compared to plants grown in rainfed soil Significant increases were noted in the contents of Ca Mg K Cu Co Fe and Zn in the shoots of plants and rhizosphere of maize inoculated with the PGPR consortium The soil organic matter total nitrogen and CN ratio were increased concomitant with the decrease in the bulk density of the rhizosphere The PGPR consortium SA and their combined treatment significantly enhanced the IAA and GA contents but decreased the ABA content of shoot The rhizosphere of plants treated with PGPR SA and consortium showed a maximum accumulation of IAA GA and ABA contents the sensitive variety had much higher ABA content than the tolerant variety It is inferred from the results that rhizosphere soil of treated plants enriched with nutrients content organic matter and greater concentration of growth promoting phytohormones as well as stress hormone ABA which has better potential for seed germination and establishment of seedlings for succeeding crops View FullText',\n"," 'While the world population

plastic nets in agriculture Based on the review biobased plastic nets made from polyamino acids polysaccharide derivatives DS polyhydroxybutyrate PHB polycaprolactone PCL polyhydroxylalkanoate PHA and polylactic acid PLA are shown to be highly biodegradable compared to conventional plastics such as highdensity polyethylene HDPE polyethylene PE and polyvinyl chloride The biodegradability of these materials is due to the use of natural precursors However nonbiodegradable plastics are the materials of choice in agricultural applications for the following reasons Global commercial production of biobased plastics is low due to the absence of facile and scalable production methods Even though biobased materials are ecologically benign they are limited in agricultural settings given the low tensile strength and disruption of the activities of natural insect predators such as spiders The enhancement of the material properties of biobased plastics involves a tradeoff with sustainability Chemical additives such as heavy metals and volatile compounds enhance the mechanical properties of biobased plastics but limit their sustainability The current constraints on the production of biobased plastic nets can be resolved through electrospinning techniques that facilitate the development of plastic nets with controllable composition porosity and surface areas View FullText',\n","

economic growth energy consumption electricity consumption in the agriculture sector foreign direct investment FDI and population on the environmental quality in Pakistan during the period of to We use CO emissions from the agriculture sector as a proxy indicator for environmental quality We employ various unit root tests eg ADF PP ERS KPSS and structural break unit root tests ZA CMR to check the stationarity and structural break in the data series Cointegration tests ie Johansen EngleGranger and ARDL cointegration approaches are used to ensure their robustness Results showed that significant longterm cointegration exists among the variables Findings also indicated that an increase in financial development and foreign direct investment FDI improves environmental quality whereas the increase in economic growth and electricity consumption in the agriculture sector degrades environmental quality in Pakistan Based on the findings we suggest policymakers should provide a

extension agents researchers and other stakeholders were enlisted to participate in an initiative to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphonebased apps and opensource servers for rapid data collection and management A preinstalled maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants n for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in  The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date date of emergence date of first flowering anthesis grain filling and maturity Results showed that in Ethiopia early maturing varieties took days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes whereas latematuring varieties took up to days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas In Tanzania a similar trend was observed whereas in Nigeria most existing varieties took an average of days to complete their developmental stages Furthermore the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence emergence to flowering flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development The data aggregation

Nutrient Use Efficiency in intensive agriculture is lower than for macronutrients This feature results in unsustainable financial and environmental costs Nanofertilizers are a promising application of nanotechnology in agriculture The use of nanofertilizers in an efficient and safe manner calls for knowledge about the actual effects of nanoproducts on the plant metabolism and eventually on the carrier release kinetics and nutrient accumulation Hydroxyapatite CaPOOH nanoparticles nHA have an interesting potential to be used as nanofertilizers In this study the effects of different nHA solutions stabilized with carboxymethylcellulose CMC were evaluated on germination seedling growth and metabolism of Solanum lycopersicum L used as model species Our observations showed that the percentage germination of S lycopersicum is not influenced by increasing concentrations of nHa while root elongation is strongly stimulated Tomato plants grown in hydroponics in the presence of nHA have not suffered phytotoxic effects We conclude that nHA had nontoxic effects on our model plant and therefore it could be used both as a P supplier and carrier of other elements and molecules View

against pathogens include the salicylic acid SA and jasmonic acid JAmediated pathways that act mainly against biotrophs and necrotrophs respectively However some necrotrophic pathogens such as Botrytis cinerea actively induce the SA pathway resulting in cell death that allows the pathogen to proliferate in the plant Starting from an isogenic canola Brassica napus line epilines were selected with a reduced sensitivity to SA The genes belonging to the SA pathway had an altered transcription profile in the SAtolerant lines when treated with SA Besides the already known genes of the SA pathway new SA target genes were identified creating possibilities to better understand the plant defense mechanism against pathogens The SAtolerant line with the lowest SAinduced gene expression is

the management types in southern Finland latitudes  seminatural permanent and cultivated grassland All have been grazed exclusively by horses for several decades We aimed to evaluate feeding values and horses welfare on the one hand and impacts of horses on biodiversity in boreal conditions on the other Though there were differences among the pastures the nutritional value of the vegetation in all three pastures met the energy and protein needs of most horse categories through the whole grazing season Some mineral concentrations were low compared to the requirements and supplementation of Cu Zn and Na is needed to balance the mineral intake Only minor injuries or health problems were observed All metrics of biological values as well as number of species eaten by horses were particularly high in a seminatural pasture compared to other pasture types The highest ratio of species cover preferred by horses to the total cover was found in the permanent pasture while at the regularly reseeded pasture there was a particularly high cover of species indicating low biodiversity values on grassland There was therefore a tradeoff between the quantity of forage and biological values in pastures but not in quality The results provide clear indication both for the suitability of the studied pasture types to horses and for grazing of horses for biodiversity management In each

nitrates sulfates calcium or hydrogen cyanide negatively influence the organisms use of the selenium contained in the diet The Se supplementation may reduce the incidence of metritis and ovarian cysts during the postpartum period The increase in fertility when adding Se is attributed to the reduction of the embryonic death during the first month of gestation A use of organic Se in feed would provide a better transfer of Se in calves relative to mineral Se supplementation The addition of Se yeasts in the foodstuffs of cows significantly increases the Se content and the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA in milk compared to the addition of sodium selenite The enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase is a selenodependent selenoprotein It is one of the last proteins to be affected in the event of Se deficiency This delay in response could explain the fact that several studies did not show the effect of Se supplementation on growth and weight gain of calves Enrichment of Se in the diet did not significantly affect the slaughter weight and carcass yield of bulls The impact and results of Se supplementation in cattle depend on physiological stage Se status of animals

'Postflowering frosts cause appreciable losses to the Australian chickpea industry The Northern Grains Region NGR of Australia which accounts for nearly of chickpea production in Australia is frequently subjected to such events The objective of this study was to map frost risk in chickpea in the NGR and develop strategies to minimise the impacts of such risk The Agricultural Production System Simulator APSIM modelling framework was used to determine spatial and temporal trends in postflowering frost risk The NGR could be divided into six broad subregions each delineating locations with similar frost risk The risk was nearly two to three times greater in the Southern Downs and Darling Downs subregions as compared to the Central Queensland Highlands Dawson Callide New South Wales and Northern New South WalesWestern Downs subregions There was an increasing trend in the frequency of frost events in the Southern Downs and New South Wales subregions and a decreasing trend in the Central Queensland Highlands and Dawson Callide subregions consistent with the changing climate of the NGR In each subregion frost risk declined with delayed sowings but such sowings resulted in simulation of reduced water limited yield potential unfrosted as well The model output was also used to compute and probabilities of the last day of experiencing  to C minimum temperatures and identify the earliest possible sowings that would avoid such temperatures after flowering Choosing the earliest sowing times with a frost risk could help increase overall yields in environments with high frost risk Simulations involving genotype x environment x management interactions suggested additional opportunities to minimise frost losses through the adoption of particular cultivars of differing phenology and the use of different agronomy in various environments of the NGR The study indicates that there is considerable variation in frost risk across the NGR and that manipulating flowering times either through time of sowing or cultivar choice could assist in minimising yield losses in chickpea due to frost View FullText',\n"," 'Clay minerals are very common in nature and highly reactive minerals which are typical products of the weathering of the most abundant silicate minerals on the planet Over recent decades there has been growing appreciation that the prime involvement of clay minerals in the geochemical cycling of elements and pedosphere genesis should take into account the biogeochemical activity of microorganisms Microbial intimate interaction with clay minerals that has taken place on Earths surface in a geological timescale represents a complex coevolving system which is challenging to comprehend because of fragmented information and requires coordinated efforts from both clay scientists and microbiologists This review covers some important aspects of the interactions of clay minerals with microorganisms at the different levels of complexity starting from organic molecules individual and aggregated microbial cells fungal and bacterial symbioses with photosynthetic organisms pedosphere up to environmental and biotechnological

has been hypothesized that many problems related to the burying of straw can be overcome by pyrolyzing it The objective of this study was to determine the effect of straw and its biochar on the biomass production of perennial ryegrass A potbased experiment was conducted with three factors i the crop species used as feedstock ii raw or pyrolyzed organic material and iii the rate of organic amendments The soil in the pots was amended with straw and biochar produced from Miscanthus Miscanthus  giganteus or winter wheat Triticum aestivum L After soil amendment application perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L seeds were sown During two years of the experiment the perennial ryegrass aboveground biomass production and root biomass and morphology parameters were determined Straw and biochar resulted in higher perennial ryegrass aboveground biomass compared with that of the nonfertilized control However straw amendment resulted in lower plant yields of aboveground biomass than those of the biochar treatments or the mineral fertilizer control treatment The feedstock type Miscanthus or wheat significantly affected the perennial ryegrass yield No difference was observed among wheat and Miscanthus biochar while among straws Miscanthus resulted in lower perennial ryegrass productivity the higher rate of straw and biochar as soil amendments resulted in relatively high perennial ryegrass productivity The organic amendments resulted in relatively high root biomass and length The rootshoot ratio was lower in the treatments in which biochar was used whereas feedstock

RADARSAT InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multitemporal radar data The results for a threeyear period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the icesnowfree time period for the day repeat cycle of RADARSAT However open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence but also high variability of coherence and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands From this knowledge we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness backscatter

conditions changing potato clones resistant to variable water supply are needed and identifying them is a major task Many indices assessing potato tolerance to water deficit have been proposed albeit none of them takes into account the severity of the stress or the sensitivity of the developmental stage during which the stress occurs As a result data obtained on genotypes in one location or season are normally not useful in another location or in a different season We have developed an index evaluating yield response of potato to water deficit based on the soil tension the genotype was subjected to for the duration of the stress modified by the development stage of the genotype The sum of the daily values was combined in a stress severity index SSI In total thirteen genotypes differing in duration and sensitivity to drought were subjected to four levels of deficit irrigation on two soil types at different development stages over two years Early drought early tuber filling reduced yields up to whereas late drought late tuber bulking reduced yields significantly less SSI depended on the genotypic phenological development and on the soil tension values and ranges between

slows down breeding considerably Inducing earlier and abundant flowering in crossing nurseries involving erect genotypes is a key objective for cassava and was the subject of this study Five genotypes with contrasting flowering behavior were grown under dark night DN and extended photoperiod EP conditions for three seasons EP was achieved with different red light emitting diodes LEDs with  nm wavelength all night long or through nightbreaks EP reduced height and number of days to first branching particularly in non or lateflowering genotypes A minimum of mol m s was required to elicit earlier flowering in plants illuminated all night Early results using five genotypes were validated across genotypes planted in a crossing nursery EP promoted earlier flowering in erectplant genotypes

breeding nurseries Night breaks also proved effective thus opening the possibility of using solar panels where electricity is not available View FullText',\n"," 'The industrial need for safflower Carthamus tinctorius L increased over the last decade due to its potential use as food colorant Safflower is mainly cultivated in Asia for its use as floret In Germany an economically attractive cultivation for floret use would require a mechanization of harvest In order to develop a mechanical harvesting system field experiments were conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof of the University Hohenheim in and Safflower was harvested with a combine harvester to obtain the florets Two safflower i cultivars were harvested with ii three threshing parameter settings on iii five harvest dates to evaluate threshed floret yield dry matter and carthamidin content and carthamidin yield Results showed that the maximum threshed floret yield was achieved at the latest harvest date  kg ha while the highest carthamidin contents were observed depending on cultivar on the first two harvest dates  The decisive and resulting amount of carthamidin yield reached its maximum with the Chinese cultivar and the threshing parameter setting P between the fourth and fifth harvest date in  kg ha Highest dry matter contents were achieved at the last harvest date  Individual capitula weight and carthamidin content decreased with later harvest dates Further investigations should clarify whether the individual capitula weight and carthamidin content correlate with each other or are independent of the date of harvest This could be a decisive criterion for the selection of cultivars for harvesting florets with a combine harvester Reduced costs of machine harvesting compared to hand harvesting will make the cultivation of safflower for the food coloring industry in Germany more attractive in the future View FullText',\n"," 'Access and use of seed of improved varieties of groundnut among farmers can improve farmers livelihoods and contribute to the potential of crop production in Tanzania This paper analyzes factors underpinning the adoption of improved groundnut varieties among farmers to pave the way for upscaling quality seed used for increased production and commodity business in farming communities A fourstage stratified sampling was used to collect data from groundnut farmers in seven agroecological zones through individual interviews Secondary data were collected from the literature and the Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute at Naliendele centre TARINaliendele Descriptive statistics and Probit regression model were used for data analysis The empirical results showed that Johari Pendo Naliendele Mnanje Mangaka and Nachi are the main six improved groundnut varieties used by farmers with Pendo having the highest adoption rate In the grain market four varieties namely Pendo Mnanje Nachi and Johari were observed to be highly preferred by grain offtakers Furthermore among the adopted improved varieties Nachi is observed to be the most consistent high yielding variety ranging from kgha to kgha in all agroecological zones A farmers decision to adopt new varieties is affected by age and gender farmer group membership availability of improved seed and seed cost Overall male farmers are more likely to adopt improved varieties of

two successive years with crop and treatment during the preceding winter as either a organic broccoli b conventional broccoli c organic faba bean used as green manure or d fallow Common bean was either inoculated with Rhizobium tropici CIAT or noninoculated while faba bean was inoculated or noninoculated with Rhizobium laguerreae VFLE Inoculating faba bean with rhizobia enhanced dry biomass production and biological Nfixing ability in both experimental years Furthermore organic farming did not restrict the yield of broccoli compared to conventional practices during the first year while the reverse was the case in the second year due to reduced soil N availability Furthermore green manure enhanced the fresh pod yield in the following organic crop of common bean in both years The

expressions and classification methods on cultivar identification the performance of the feature expressions and classification algorithms affecting the accuracy of cultivar identification was evaluated by image processing techniques A total of samples of seeds from seven cultivars of sweet corn namely Orlando Beiyasi Jingketian Jingtian Suitian CT and Lilixiangtian were evaluated The color shape and texture features of the seeds were extracted from the images and the class separability criterion was adopted to evaluate the separability of the features of the embryo side nonembryo side and both of them combined The results indicate that the class separability based on the features of the embryo side was higher than that based on the nonembryo side and both of them combined Based on

agricultural situations were compared The intensive animal and vegetable production observed in the Netherlands over the past  years was found to substantially contribute to the heavy metal input of these systems Agriculture in Poland is on the brink of a rapid economical and technological push promoted by the recent admission of Poland to the EU The current low levels of organic fertilization in this country are expected to increase dramatically in the next few years leading to an increased environmental burden of heavy metals similar to that observed in the Netherlands Awareness of the danger of heavy metals to public health is slowly taking hold as the EU takes up its responsibility regarding the maximum limits of some of these compounds allowed in mineral fertilizers However the authors would like to stress that the major contribution of heavy metals arises from the use of organic fertilizers Proper dealing with this through means of adaptation of feed regimes andor remediation could both safeguard the yet unpolluted soils in Poland and prove essential to halt the ongoing pollution of soils in the Netherlands',\n"," 'To publish papers that have impact is indispensable for good scientists It is frequently accepted that the impact factor IF of a journal reflects the likelihood of a paper to have impact Many scientists may then attempt publishing their papers in journals with the highest possible IF This is relevant for crop scientists as in many cases our hypotheses may be relevant to agronomyagriculture but the product of our work may be published in the more basic plant science journals which in general have higher IF than agronomic journals To test whether agronomic journals may be better vehicles than plant science journals for crop physiological work I did an analysis of my own publications only standard papers disregarding reviews relating their annual citation rates against the IF of the journal in which they were published The relationship was virtually inexistent and my most frequently quoted papers were published in agronomic rather than in plant sciences journals Conversely restricting the analysis to the papers published within agronomic journals there was a relationship between the record of citations of the papers and the IF of the journals particularly if the analysis is restricted to the most quoted papers in each journal I then analyzed the cases of three other wellrecognized crop scientists to check whether the findings with my results were exceptional and in the three cases results were remarkably similar Therefore it seems that the journal IF might be a valuable criterion for choosing the best journal in which to publish our best contributions only when comparing within agronomic journals but not within combinations of agronomy and plant science journals This should be also taken into account in evaluation processes when comparing scientists working in related but not identical fields',\n"," 'Whole wheat bread represents an important source of dietary fiber and micronutrients such as minerals and vitamins The decrease of daily B vitamins thiamine riboflavin and pyridoxine intake could be connected to a decrease of bread consumption and a greater consumption of refined products The aim of this work was thus to estimate the variability of thiamine riboflavin and pyridoxine concentrations in wheat and to evaluate if this variability is conserved from the grain to the bread in order to identify wheat cultivars with high nutritional potential Extraction and analysis of B vitamins by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC have been carried out for wheat cultivars bread wheat durum bread spelts grown under the same environmental conditions in nursery plots Based on grain thiamine concentration nine cultivars were selected to constitute three groups with low medium and high grain thiamine concentration and the concentration of B vitamins of their corresponding white and reconstituted flours and white and whole breads was determined Grains showed a high variability for B vitamin concentrations ranging from to g g dry matter DM for thiamine from to g g DM for riboflavin and from to g g DM for pyridoxine After milling and of thiamine riboflavin and pyridoxine were recovered in white flour compared to and in reconstituted whole wheat flour respectively After bread making the impoverishment in thiamine and pyridoxine was less pronounced in whole wheat bread  and  for thiamine and pyridoxine respectively than in white bread  and  for thiamine and pyridoxine respectively In contrast riboflavin concentration was twofold higher in bread than in white flour The genetic variability of B vitamin concentrations was conserved after milling and bread making especially for cultivars that have high B vitamin concentrations in whole flour In conclusion it appears that B vitamin concentrations of cereal products are also under genetic control and the variability in B vitamin concentrations is an important factor to take into account for wheat selection',\n"," 'The analysis of the evolution of crop yield reveals a change in grain composition increases in yield have led to a decrease in the protein to starch or oil ratios This negative relationship reflects the higher increase of C assimilation compared with N assimilation For wheat Triticum aestivum L flour protein concentration is the main quality criterion especially for bread making Therefore a critical question for the future is how to manage the relationship between yield and N concentration where the objective is to increase both the level and stability of yield and N concentration To answer these questions we need a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the variations of yield and of its composition First of all we need to analyse genetic variability in different environments that allow the identification of genetic sources of variation that can be used for breeding or in more reductionist approaches In this paper we used data from controlled environment and field experiments at canopy and plant level and at different sinksource ratios to analyse the genetic and environmental relationship between grain productivity and composition These experiments confirmed the strong negative relationship between grain yield and N concentration Postanthesis temperature and water deficit had significant effects on grain yield and protein concentration but they did not modify the negative relationship between these variables However preanthesis water deficit decreased the sinksource ratio resulting in a lower intercept while the slope was unchanged Nitrogen deficiency also modified the intercept of the negative relationship but more importantly it decreased the slope three to fourfold Thus under limiting N conditions grain N concentration is more sensitive to yield variation than under nonlimiting N conditions Genetic variation of single grain dry mass and of the sinksource ratios had similar effects to the environmental variation Three major conclusions can be drawn from these results the negative relationship between grain yield and protein concentration is primarily determined at the stem level the grain itself is more limiting for starch synthesis than for protein synthesis and overall any increase in yield is followed by an increase of N utilisation and use efficiency',\n"," 'Crop simulation models are important tools to enhance our knowledge of plant processes and responses to the environment The objective of this effort was to reevaluate the algorithms in CERESWheat that simulate grain mass and grain nitrogen concentration two primary determinants of grain enduse quality Data from two contrasting wheat Triticum aestivum L cultivars collected over three growing seasons with varying sowing dates and plant population densities were used in this study Grain mass was simulated using a sourcesink approach The source was current dry matter production and translocation of stem reserves The sink was the number of grains and a surrogate for cell division and cell expansion within each grain Cell division and expansion were functions of temperature stress term and water stress during anthesis The translocated stem reserves were a function of temperature stage of plant development and a measure of the sink demand The nitrogen concentration algorithm was modified by making the minimum stover above ground organs not including the spike nitrogen a cultivar dependent parameter which would allow more or less nitrogen available for translocation depending upon the cultivar It was assumed that there was a linear relationship between the number of aborted grains at the beginning of the linear grain filling period and the increase in grain nitrogen concentration It was further assumed that an initial grain nitrogen mass at the beginning of the linear grain filling period was equal to the initial grain mass times the simulated actual nitrogen concentration of the above ground biomass The root mean square error RMSE for grain mass for both cultivars was and mg for CERESWheat and the modified model respectively The advantage of the modified model is that it does not require a genetic coefficient to simulate grain mass as does CERESWheat The RMSE for grain nitrogen concentration for both cultivars was and mg N g DM for CERESWheat and the modified model respectively However when the mean square error was divided into systematic and unsystematic errors there were inconsistent results for grain mass and grain nitrogen concentration for the same model with different cultivars indicating a lack of plasticity of response Incorporating this plasticity into future algorithms of key plant processes and further evaluations of the modified model in other wheat growing regions should be carried out to determine the robustness of these responses',\n"," 'Effects of mineral nutrition and temperature on accumulation and composition of protein in wheat grains and on baking quality were studied under controlled environments Under a moderate temperature regimen of C days and C nights C postanthesis NPK NPK supplied by continuous drip irrigation increased the rate of protein accumulation doubled flour protein percentage and slightly increased final single kernel weight In contrast postanthesis NPK had almost no effect on rate or duration of protein accumulation or flour protein percentage under a high temperature regimen of C days and C nights C The C regimen shortened and compressed the stages of grain fill reduced the duration of dry matter accumulation and reduced single kernel weight by Rate and duration of protein accumulation in thermal time and total protein per grain at C with or without NPK were similar to that at C in the absence of postanthesis NPK Protein percentage was higher for flour from grain produced at C with or without NPK than at C in the presence of postanthesis NPK Transcript and protein profiling studies confirmed that the C regimen compressed development without disrupting coordinate synthesis of gliadins and glutenin subunits although some specific effects of NPK and temperature on relative amounts of individual gliadins and glutenins were observed Transcript levels for gliadins gliadins and high molecular weight glutenin subunits HMWGS declined at C in the absence of postanthesis NPK whereas transcript levels for low molecular weight glutenin subunits LMWGS and gliadins showed little change Twodimensional gel electrophoresis DE demonstrated that relative spot volumes for several gliadins gliadins and HMWGS were lower at C in the absence than in the presence of postanthesis NPK whereas the relative spot volume for a major LMWGS was lower in the presence of NPK Effects of temperature on relative spot volume were generally smaller than effects of NPK Compared to the C regimen in the absence of postanthesis NPK relative spot volume for some gliadins and HMWGS were higher at C with or without NPK and relative spot volume for a major LMWGS decreased at C Loaf volume was correlated with flour protein percentage regardless of temperature regimen but mixing tolerance was highest for flour from grain produced under the C regimens with NPK',\n"," 'Protein concentration and composition are key components of the enduse value for wheat Triticum aestivum L grain Although the qualitative composition of the grain is genetically determined the quantitative composition is significantly modified by growing conditions and there are important management  genotype  environment interactions We recently reported a model of grain N accumulation and partitioning for wheat grain The main assumptions made in this model are the accumulation of structuralmetabolic proteins albuminsglobulins and amphiphils is sinkdriven and is a function of temperature the accumulation of storage proteins gliadins and glutenins is supply limited on the one hand the allocation of structuralmetabolic proteins between albuminglobulin and amphiphilic protein fractions and on the other hand the allocation of storage protein between gliadin and glutenin fractions during grain growth is constant A modified version of this grain model has been coupled with a revised version of the wheat simulation model Sirius allowing us to analyze the interactions between the vegetative sources and the reproductive sinks for N at the crop level The main modifications to Sirius concerned the postanthesis N uptake and remobilisation After anthesis the potential rate of crop N uptake was assumed to decrease linearly with accumulated thermal time and the actual rate of N uptake was limited by the capacity of the stem to store accumulated N During grain filling the daily rate of N transfer to grain was calculated daily according to the current crop Nstatus The coupled model SiriusQuality simulated dynamics of total grain N and of the different grain protein fractions reasonably well At maturity measured total grain N ranged from to mg N grain and the observed and simulated total grain N were well correlated r slope with a mean error of prediction of mg N grain The simulated kinetics of crop N accumulation and stem N were closer to the observations with SiriusQuality than with Sirius in particular during the reproductive stage At maturity simulated and observed quantities of albuminsglobulins were poorly correlated r Over the experimental cases studied here the quantity of storage proteins varied more than threefold and the observed and simulated quantities of gliadins and glutenins were well correlated r and respectively The simulations of total N and storage proteins accumulation provided by SiriusQuality confirmed that accumulation of grain N is overall source rather than sinkregulated at least under nonluxury N conditions

environmental protection and balanced plant nutrition as starting points and integrates concepts from plant physiology soil chemistry and agronomy The framework is meant as a tool that can be applied even if no local experimental results are known Saturated soil fertility and ideal soil fertility constitute the bench marks of the framework Saturated soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil by itself does exactly satisfy the nutrient demand of a crop producing the target yield provided no nutrients get lost Ideal soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil in combination with replacement input exactly satisfies that nutrient demand Replacement input is an input equal to the quantity of nutrients removed in harvested crop Saturated soil fertility is calculated as a function

for K the soil is relatively low in N high in P and medium in K at ideal soil fertility The supplies of N P and K to the crop by soil and replacement input together are wellbalanced The ratio of ideal

CIMMYT cultivars Ciano genotype and Attila genotype respectively heat sensitive and heat tolerant varieties for warm environments Plants were grown in pots at two different daynight temperatures and C in climatecontrolled glasshouses and exposed to a day heat shock during the grainfilling phase To investigate its effect on quality and yield the following traits were included grain dry mass flour protein concentration glutenin macro polymer GMP fraction glutenin particle size and particle size distribution The magnitude in which a heat shock during grain filling affects quality and yield depends on the heat tolerance of genotypes and the preceding ambient growth temperature As expected the responses to heat varied between and within genotypes on the one hand grain size and dry mass decreased on the other hand protein related traits were improved In genotype Lavett a negative correlation was found between flour protein concentration and grain dry mass However in genotype Attila flour protein concentration remained quite stable under a wide range of grain dry mass in response to the treatments Genotype Ciano showed an intermediate response These big differences in genotypic response do have a potential significant impact for maintaining quality under adverse conditions In all genotypes the effect of heat stress was larger when plants were grown at C compared to C especially grain dry mass was decreased while flour protein and GMP protein fraction GMP quantity as well as particle size were significantly increased The results show that genetic differences in stability of quality and yield in wheat under heat stress can be induced by a short heatshock treatment during the grainfilling phase It is concluded that an evaluation of quality and yield responses of wheat genotypes to short spells of heat could considerably be improved by a heatshock treatment during the early grainfilling phase',\n"," 'Lutein and its stereoisomer zeaxanthin are the major

for breeding since it presents a high carotenoid concentration to LOX activity ratio a selection criteria that predicts an optimal conservation of carotenoid pigments in bread Total carotenoid

from to ppm but increased to ppm in some genetic resources Variation in Zn was also partly explained by a dilution effect There was a significant effect of genotype but also high G  E interactions which would make direct selection more difficult than for Mg However as Zn and Mg concentrations appeared to be positively correlated Zn concentration should respond favorably to selection for high Mg

Since the farm has succeeded in realising low N surpluses kg N ha and low nitrate concentrations  mean mg l A clear relation was found between N management as expressed by the N surplus and nitrate concentration in the groundwater However in some years this relation was disturbed The results show the value of N balance sheets for reducing N losses From an agricultural point of view a major advantage of a system such as MINAS is the autonomy it gives farmers to determine how and where they will reduce the N surplus Using MINAS however is no guarantee that a nitrate concentration of mg l will always be achieved',\n"," 'Since the pioneering work of CT de Wit in the s the Wageningen group has built a tradition in developing and applying crop models Rather than focusing on a few models diversity is its trademark Here we present an overview of the Wageningen crop and cropsoil modelling approaches along three criteria The first criterion relates to the production situations the models are dealing with ie potential water andor nutrientlimited and actual production situations including pests diseases and weeds Second models differ as a result of the objectives of model development and hence required scale and degree of detail and comprehensiveness Third models have at least three potential application domains ie research education and support of learning and decision making processes We describe both summary and more comprehensive modelling approaches for the major production situations An overview of most of the Wageningen models is presented together with a more detailed description of LINTUL SUCROS ORYZA WOFOST and INTERCOM Illustrations for each of the three application domains are presented ie plant type design guiding experimental research education yield gap analysis evaluation of manure policies crop growth monitoring system and analysis and design of farming and regional land use systems We discuss common issues of model verification model validation model validity and data requirements and present information on software implementation model and software documentation and distribution policy Finally we reflect upon the Wageningen modelling approaches and identify a number of key issues for future research Major achievements of Wageningen modelling efforts include a broad variety of approaches for modelling of systems at different scales and with different purposes their contribution to quantitative systems thinking in general also for applications at higher hierarchical levels a strong linkage between crop modelling and higher education both at undergraduate graduate and postdoctoral level To continually increase our understanding of crops and production systems a diversified approach must be cherished At the same time we conclude that focus is required on a limited number of modules in a more integrated modelling framework for the benefit of analysing evaluating and designing cropping systems This review may be instrumental in the development of such an integrated framework',\n"," 'Rice agriculture is not only affected by climate change but also contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere In a major research project was initiated at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines to investigate relationships between climate change and rice production A second project started in to investigate in more detail mitigation options that could be employed to help reduce CH emissions from rice cultivation An important component of all of this work was the quantification of these interactions between climate change and rice production into simulation models and their subsequent use to upscale field measurements to national and regional levels The first project developed such a model to integrate existing knowledge of effects of increased levels of CO and temperature on rice growth and used this to predict the impact of various climate change scenarios on rice production in SE Asia In the second project routines describing the dynamics of CH production and emission from the soil were linked to a crop simulation model to estimate the effect of different crop management scenarios on national CH emissions from various countries in the region With the recent completion of the second project it is timely to review this modelling work describing the relationships between the global environment and rice production a task which we attempt in the present paper The advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approaches used and other issues relating to the upscaling of field measurements to national and regional levels are discussed Future research directions in this area are also identified',\n"," 'Accumulation of

and from agricultural land is relatively small compared with the total stock of organic N in soil However the longterm humus N pool dynamics is seldom considered in fertilisation planning and thus N surpluses in budgets are considered as losses In this paper we analyse the consequences of this assumption and investigate how observed data precision affect the precision of model projections We used available data sets from longterm agricultural field experiments in Sweden topsoil C and N concentrations crop yields as well as soil type and climate data for calculating topsoil C and N mass dynamics ICBMN a simple C and N soil model available at wwwmvslusevaxtnaringolleICBMhtml was used for calculating soil organic matter balances We parameterised this model for two field trials and for specific crops using available data and educated guesses and compared the results with those obtained from the conventional approach not including humus pool C and N dynamics In spite of the corrections for bulk densities etc the soil carbon measurements were too variable for a critical model validation or a sensitive test of the effects of including pool dynamics In other words we had to rely on the model assumptions for the projections and soil data could only be used to obtain general means eg for the whole duration of the experiment We think this is a general problem not limited to this data set and model We also show at least in principle how estimates of organic N pool dynamics can be used to produce improved N balance sheets for individual crops For example the apparent N use efficiency by sugar beet increased from to when organic N pool dynamics were included',\n"," 'A procedure aimed at identifying cropping systems suitable for environmentally sensitive areas has been

were the most commonly included of the IOAs studied Looking at the single subject systems most were nutrients with only three pesticide and one energy based system In total systems covered nutrients Overall where specified nutrient budgets covered nitrogen N phosphorus P and potassium K in cases N and P in cases N only in nine and P only in four cases The most common indicators for nutrient budgets were calculation of a balance followed by nitrate leached The method by which indicators were evaluated and presented to farmers varied Farming sectors were not equally represented with systems for the arable dairy and pig sectors the most common Farmers received a detailed interpretation of their results in two thirds of the systems most commonly related to official limits or targets Most of the systems were developed to reduce adverse environmental impacts and of the systems were considered by the respondents to have had a positive environmental impact by reducing surpluses or improving waste disposal Use of five of the systems could lead to a marketing advantage via certified produce with a recognised quality label Where factual evidence as to effectiveness was available the benefits varied between subject types nutrients energy and pesticides and between sectors Farmers responses to the systems were generally positive and they appear to be a useful way of raising awareness of environmental problems However economic issues need to be considered if the costs to the farmer outweigh the benefits uptake will not be sustained The type and nature of the interpretation is also important as the most successful IOAs in terms of continued use and interest appeared to be those where there was regular technical input from an adviser Overall IOAs could offer a useful tool for voluntary improvement in agrienvironmental performance on topics that are not already strongly regulated But more studies are needed to ensure that farmers in reality change their behaviour and to develop the use of reference values',\n"," 'The EC Nitrate Directive agreed by the EC Environment Council in is an environmental measure designed to protect water against pollution caused by nitrate from agriculture In the River Ythan catchment a ha area of predominantly agricultural land in NE Scotland was designated a nitrate vulnerable zone NVZ by the Scottish Executive A combination of reasons for designation was suggested including evidence of elevated nitrate concentrations in the surface waters of the catchment together with the criteria set out at Annex IA of the EC Nitrates Directive ie that the estuary is eutrophic or in the near future may become eutrophic Evidence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency surface water monitoring sites has revealed several tributaries of the Ythan with nitrate concentrations exceeding the maximum permitted level of mg l mg l NON and a rising trend in the main river channel There has been an approximate threefold increase in surface water nitrate concentrations since the early s to a current value of  mg l mg l NON There is separate evidence of elevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater The amounts of fertiliser N applied annually has also increased substantially and in these were estimated to be  of the total N equivalent to kg ha added to the catchment Various stages have been involved in the decision to designate including documents for public consultation and a proposed Action Programme However several issues remain to be resolved especially the extent to which a causal relationship actually exists between the increased loss of nitrate to the estuary and algal growth Being able to accurately apportion sources of N supply with periods of uptake within the aquatic system is complicated Here we suggest that an estimated of the terrestrially derived nitrate input to the estuarine system actually occur out with the main period of algal growth This emphasises the need for a greater understanding of the spatial and temporal linkages that exist between N cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems particularly as this will directly influence the likely success and cost effectiveness of remedial measures taken to relieve the symptoms of eutrophication',\n"," 'The software irene Integrated Resources for Evaluating Numerical Estimates is a data

used and are incorporated within national action programs to combat nutrient emissions from agriculture to the environment They rely on data that are readily available at farmgate and field level and the information generated is easy to communicate to farmers and policy makers This may have contributed to high expectations on element balances as a tool for optimising agricultural nutrient use efficiency and thereby reducing nutrient losses Element balances are potentially useful as a screening tool across Europe provided the methods to calculate them are standardised their limitations and usefulness defined and appropriate target values are established by which they can be compared It is difficult to establish straightforward relationships between nutrient management surplus losses and environmental impact Simple farmgate and field balances need to be complemented by a better understanding of the processes regulating nutrient dynamics and their spatial and temporal variability Hence

agricultural system to the environment and can be applied at different geographical scales from field to regional When information is collected from individual farmers the sample size is usually small as compared to the total number of the farms in a particular area Official databases when present are more objective and contain information on all the farms in the area and as such provide information regarding the variability that exists between farms of a region A geographical information system was built using all the information available in official databases to estimate soil surface nutrient balances at a regional scale within a ha area in Northwest Italy where agriculture is very intensive The nutrient surplus was calculated for the main farm types Dairy farms showed the greatest surplus for all nutrients considered with values greater than kg ha for N and K and kg ha for P Pig livestock farms followed next with excesses greater than kg N ha kg P ha and kg K ha Cattle livestock farms showed the lowest surplus compared to the other livestock farms with values close to kg N ha kg P ha and kg K ha Farms without livestock showed the closest equilibrium between fertilisation and offtake with a surplus in N P and K equal to and kg ha respectively Despite the fact that local legislation only regulates slurry management precisely it appeared that larger surpluses could be associated to the use of solid manure Scenario analyses showed that manure exchange between farms in the area could lead to a drastic reduction in the use of mineral fertilisers but at the regional scale an acceptable surplus can only be attained for N and K while the excess of P remains a serious problem for the environment The study indicated where the lack of information appears to be more critical and suggested options for a more accurate and organised acquisition of data The results can be used for further studies for instance with the aim of estimating the fate of

the inland waters and the Baltic Sea The results of a year study of three small agricultural catchments Vienziemite Berze and Mellupite and three drainage fields in these catchments indicated that the most important factors of agricultural pollution are acreage of arable crops farming practices and nutrient management In particular attention was focused on the land use as well as on the effects of the soil nutrient balance Large variations in N losses Ntot kg ha per year could be demonstrated The losses appeared to be smaller than the results under similar cropping systems and soils in the Nordic countries where the measured losses were  kg ha per year The most significant increase of nitrogen loss was associated with the large share of arable land and increased fertiliser application in Berze small catchment during the last  years The negligible increase of nitrogen leakage in Vienziemite catchment had resulted from the low input agriculture with a negative N balance The results indicate that the N balance as well as the land use play an important role in the leakage of nutrients from drainage and small catchments',\n"," 'There has recently been a strong tendency for agricultural production in periurban areas in southern Vietnam to move away from low input rice production to more intensive fruit and vegetable production often in combination with pig production The access to a market has led to increased availability of fertilisers and livestock feed in these areas which has resulted in a dramatic increase in nutrient inputs The objective of this study was to describe nutrient management on smallholder farming systems in a periurban area outside Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam Nutrient management was assessed by nutrient balances and flows and the data were gathered through interviews with local farmers and measurement of inputs and outputs Nine farms were selected containing one or more of the following production units pig crops and fish Feedstuffs and fertilisers were important sources of input of N P and K on the livestock farms On the farms without pig production ash constituted on average of all K input but for N and P fertilisers were the dominant forms of input Farmgate balances for N P and K were positive on all farms and were in the range  kg N ha per year  kg P ha per year and  kg K ha per year The different production units were poorly integrated as nutrient output from one unit seldom matched nutrient demand as estimated by nutrient output in the next unit All pig production units showed similar nutrient use efficiencies but there were large differences between the crop units varying greatly both among different crops and for the same crop among the farms The crop units were characterised by large nutrient surpluses and low nutrient efficiencies indicating a high risk for nutrient losses to the wider environment The results highlight the farmers need for better tools to optimise farm nutrient management both through better integration of the production units but especially also by improving crop nutrient use efficiency',\n"," 'For most poor countries of today using agriculture for development is widely recognized as a promising strategy Yet in these countries investment in agriculture has mostly been lagging relative to international norms and recommendations Current wisdom on how to use agriculture for development is that it requires asset building for smallholder farmers productivity growth in staple foods an agricultural transformation diversification of farming systems toward high value crops and a rural transformation value addition through rural nonfarm activities linked to agriculture This sequence has too often been hampered by extensive market and government failures We outline a theory of change where the removal of market and government failures to use this Agriculture for Development strategy can be addressed through two contrasted and complementary approaches One is from the supplyside where public and social agents governments international and bilateral development agencies NGOs donors intervene to help farmers overcome the major constraints to adoption liquidity risk information and access to markets The other is from the demandside where private agents entrepreneurs producer organizations create incentives for smallholder farmers to modernize through contracting and vertical coordination in value chains We review the extensive literature that has explored ways of using Agriculture for Development through these two approaches We conclude by noting that the supplyside approach has benefited from extensive research but met with limited success The demandside approach has promise but received insufficient attention and is in

involvement ii how is the notion of social impact defined and operationalised iii through what practices and narratives is African agriculture specifically constructed as a site for investment and iv what are the politicaleconomic implications of the resulting assemblage of actors metrics and motivations especially in terms of what and where is rendered investable We draw on a cultural political

science into how such economic processes take on particular meanings through historically and geographically specific practices and discourses We show that SII is driven by commercial interests shifts in investment in relation to the growth of ethical capitalism and shifts in philanthropic circles to viewing SII as a mechanism to access alternative sources of funding SII is thus not simply a tool for creating new sources of funding for existing development activities It is changing development policy and practice by bringing in new actors most notably private equity funds and institutional

sustainability goals in developing countries Over the past decade the international community has committed billions of dollars to support various practices under the banner of CSA Despite this effort however CSA adoption remains low in many contexts Lack of conceptual clarity about the range of potential farmlevel CSA practices across contexts impedes understanding of CSA adoption in developing countries Here we review relevant literature to develop a typology of farmlevel CSA practices to facilitate analyses of CSA adoption The typology consists of six categories organized from least to most resource intensive residue addition nonwoody plant cultivation assisted regeneration woody plant cultivation physical infrastructure and mixed measures We use the typology to generate and test hypotheses about CSA adoption using primary household survey data from a large aidfunded CSA intervention area in southern Malawi We then use recursive bivariate probit regression controlling for endogeneity and selection bias to estimate the effect of program participation on adoption across CSA categories We find positive and statistically significant effects of program participation on adoption of CSA practices generally with the strongest effects on resourceintensive CSA categories Results demonstrate the potential for wider application of the typology to build knowledge of the effectiveness of CSA promotion efforts across different social and environmental contexts Our findings also suggest the importance of external support for the adoption of more resourceintensive CSA

been welcomed for its potential to bring capital into long neglected rural areas but has also raised concerns over implications for customary land rights and the terms of integration of local land and labor into global supply chains In global development policy and discourse the concept of inclusive business has become central in efforts to resolve these tensions with the idea that integrating smallholders and other disadvantaged actors into partnerships with agribusiness firms can generate benefits for national economies private investors and local livelihoods Scholarly treatment of the topic has tended to be polarized into winlose narratives or points to the contingency and social differentiation of localized experiences This review paper takes a different approach exploring published evidence on the structural factors shaping agricultural value chains and their implications for social inclusion We develop a typology of seven agricultural value chains and use this to select a sample of crops in specific world regions for an analysis of how structural factors in value chain relations from crop features to market dynamics and policy drivers  affect social inclusion and exclusion Such an approach allows us to ask whether inclusive agribusiness is a realistic goal given the broader structuring of agribusiness and the global economic system Our study finds that while the characteristics of specific crops and supply chains exert a strong influence on opportunities and constraints to inclusion the overall trend is towards more exclusive agribusiness as governments scale back support to smallholders more stringent standards raise barriers to entry and firms streamline operations to enhance competitiveness This raises questions about the feasibility of this goal under the current political economic system Findings point to the need to reconsider the policy choices behind these trends and how we deploy the fiscal legislative and gatekeeper functions of the state to shape agrarian trajectories',\n"," 'Malnutrition remains a problem across India particularly among women and children in rural areas In response nutritionsensitive

research sites in northern Jharkhand and eastern Madhya Pradesh have seen agricultural practices shift from more diverse traditional cropping to highyielding rice over the past decade this research examines womens responses to these new NSA promotion efforts This month study employed ethnographic methods including participant observation and interviews with village women along with NGO and government workers across both sites This analysis employed an equity framework based on the decolonial concept of cognitive justice which asserts that epistemological inequity precedes socioeconomic inequities The findings suggest while all respondents reacted positively to the tenets of NSA promotion due to highyielding paddys labor requirements and cultural aspirations to maximize rice production many farmers especially those engaged in improved paddy cultivation were unable to adopt NSA practices robustly While poorer farmers not growing improved paddy were better positioned to adopt NSA many were less active in SHG activities due to structural barriers and an observed lack of cognitive justice As NSA programs are still emerging little research has detailed the ways such efforts may exacerbate or allay rural inequities This study suggests NSA could have more impact on cropping practices and nutrition outcomes if it led with an equity approach centered on cognitive

worldwide spending of blue gold Development of sustainable irrigation practices will require that we understand better the biophysical processes of rootwater uptake in soil and transpiration from plant canopies Our review paper is divided into four parts models measurements knowledge gaps and policy First we present a retrospective on what has been done with rootwater uptake models since the pioneering scheme of Wilford R Gardner in His solution for water movement to a plant root was analytical Since then nearly all the models calculate water flow using numerical solutions of the Richards equation These schema include a wateruptake term specifically for the distributed uptake of water from soil by the root system These models fall into two groups based on how the uptake term is handled The most common formulations called Type I have evolved from the work of Gardner Gardner WR Dynamic aspects of water availability to plants Soil Sci  and describe the microscale physics of water flow from the soil to and through the plant roots The second form Type II comprises macroscopic empirical functions that describe uptake based on responses to water potential We discuss the merits and potential of these schemes Yet models are data hungry Effective modeling requires apposite parameterisation to be effective This can require substantive empiricism Second we present new data on the functioning of rootwater uptake and transpiration by kiwifruit vines We describe new observations in the root zone obtained using arrays of time domain reflectometry TDR sensors As well we present results obtained with new methods of sapflow measurement inside the kiwifruit vines roots These reveal the uptake dynamics during partial root zone drying PRD a technique ofttouted to reduce irrigation volumes Next we outline future research needs This includes a requirement to infer better the matric potential at the soilroot boundary and its control on plant transpiration We suggest that the role of reverse flow and specification of the root resistance also needs more researching Further linking the functioning of water uptake with the form of the root system will not be achievable until we know more about root resistance Canopy area and architecture are critical for controlling transpiration yet they are tiresome to measure Improved measurement techniques preferably

to N the Calliandra had still only a marginal positive effect on maize yields insignificant increase of alleycropping compared to sole maize This was explained by a negative total N balance in the soil of  kg ha and a negative inorganic N balance in the soil of  kg ha over the seven seasons The difference between total and inorganic N balance was due to a mineralisation of only of the N in all

Guadalquivir river estuary The reclaimed area near Lebrija called Sector BXII about ha has been under cultivation since Some years however water supply for irrigation is limited due to drought periods The scarcity of good quality water during the drought period  imposed on farmers the necessity to irrigate with river water which at this location is saline due to tidal flow The objective of this work was to determine the composition of the in situ soil solution and exchange complex of the reclaimed soil of a plot near Lebrija using the EXPRESO model One of the irrigations during the growing

saturated paste extract ECsp day after irrigation with saline water for both sampling depths showed an increase in comparison with the value of the samples taken just before irrigation One month later the ECsp reached a similar value to that before irrigation with saline water due to the three irrigations with fresh water The in situ soil solution characteristics simulated by EXPRESO showed higher values of the different parameters than those of the saturated paste but with similar trends ECsp at  m depth after irrigation with saline water ranged between and dS m and in situ values simulated by

irrigation scheduling model ISM developed by George et al Agric Water Manage was modified by incorporating a rice irrigation scheduling model and integrated with Geographic Information System GIS software The developed rice irrigation scheduling model is based on a daily water balance approach The model was tested by comparing daily simulated and measured water depths for kharif monsoon and rabi dry seasons for outlet l ha of the Tarafeni South Main Canal North in the Kangsabati irrigation project West Bengal India The model testing criteria consisted of graphical comparison between simulated and measured water depths deviation of water depth Dd NashSutcliff coefficient R and ztest The model predicted daily water depth reasonably well for both single and multiple field cases and performed better during rabi than kharif season The model application to the service area command of lateral distributary l ha revealed that the supply was sufficient to meet about and of the demand respectively for kharif and rabi seasons Therefore simulations were done to estimate irrigation demand for an alternative rabi crop wheat The comparison between supply and demand revealed that the supply was adequate to meet the irrigation demand of the distributary and thus wheat can be taken as an alternate crop during rabi season Based on the results it can be said that the ISM is a userfriendly model and can be used for irrigation management at different spatial scales',\n"," 'We previously reported that commercial Rhizobium leguminosarum bv trifolii inoculants failed to outcompete naturalized strains for nodule occupation of clover sown into an alkaline soil Aust J Agric Res Two field isolates that dominated nodule occupancy at the field site were labeled with a PnifHgusA marker Marked strains were chosen on the basis that they were equally competitive and fixed similar amounts of nitrogen in comparison to their parental strain The minitransposon insertions were cloned and sequence analysis revealed that neither lesion disrupted the integrity of any known gene The marked strains were then used to follow nodule occupancy of Trifolium alexandrinum in competition against the commercial inoculant TA under a range of experimental conditions In coinoculation experiments in sandvermiculite TA outcompeted each marked field isolate for nodule occupancy However using TAinoculated seed sown into alkaline soil containing a marked field strain it was demonstrated that by increasing the cell number of marked rhizobia in the soil and reducing the cell number of the commercial inoculant the proportion of nodules occupied by TA was reduced These studies indicate that the ability of the field isolates to dominate nodule occupancy in the alkaline field soils was most likely caused by poor commercial inoculant survival providing the advantage for naturalized soil rhizobia to initiate nodulation',\n"," 'Xylanase A from alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans

surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed imagery is conducted A major difference between the two models is whether the soil and vegetation components of the scene are treated separately TwoSource Energy Balance TSEB approach or as a lumped composite onesource approach Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land SEBAL in the parameterization of radiative and turbulent exchanges with the overlying air Comparisons are performed using data from two largescale field experiments covering subhumid grassland Southern Great Plains and semiarid rangeland Monsoon having very different landscape properties In general there was reasonable agreement between flux output from both models versus a handful of flux tower observations However spatial intercomparisons of model output over the full modeling domains yielded relatively large discrepancies on the order of W m in sensible heat flux H that are related to land cover In particular bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas yielded the largest discrepancies with TSEB fluxes being in better agreement with tower observations Modifications to SEBAL inputs that reduced discrepancies with TSEB and observations for bare soil and shrub classes tended to increase differences for other land cover classes In particular improvements to SEBAL inputs of surface roughness for momentum tended to exacerbate errors with respect to observed fluxes These results suggest that some of the simplifying assumptions in SEBAL may not be strictly applicable over the wide range in conditions present within these landscapes An analysis of TSEB and SEBAL sensitivity to uncertainties in primary inputs indicated that errors in surface temperature or surfaceair temperature differences had the greatest impact on H estimates Inputs of secondary importance were fractional vegetation cover for TSEB while for SEBAL the selection of pixels representing wet and dry moisture endmember conditions significantly influenced flux predictions The models were also run using input fields derived from both local and remote data sources to test performance under conditions of varying ancillary data availability In this case both models performed

the roots and on malate exudation were investigated in Altolerant Shirosanjyaku SH and Alsensitive Chikushikomugi CK wheat cultivars labelled with bicarbonateC Aluminum triggered the excretion of C into the solution especially in the SH that excreted times more C than the CK The loss of radioactivity about into the solution represented a small drain in the C reserve found in the roots In the organic acid fraction within the roots malate contained the greatest amount of C and this amount decreased rapidly with time in both cultivars The disappearance of radioactivity in the malate resulted from metabolism and translocation rather than to root efflux Aluminium decreased the malate concentrations in roots of both cultivars The Alsensitive cultivar had higher concentrations of malate regardless of the presence of Al It was therefore assumed that the decrease of malate concentration in roots under Al stress did not result from the decline in malate synthesis but due to an increase in malate decomposition This response was interpreted as the result of the Alinduced stress and not as the cause of a differential Altolerance between the wheat cultivars An important component of the differential Al tolerance between SH and CK is the greater ability of the Altolerant cultivar to excrete malate from the roots which is independent of its internal concentration in the roots',\n","

'Data augmentation which is the process for creating alternative copies of each sample in a small training data set is important for extracting deeplearning features for medical image classification problems However data augmentation has not been well explored and existing methods are heuristic In this paper a geostatistical simulation of images is introduced as a data augmentation approach for extracting deeplearning features from medical images that are characterized with texture The stochastic simulation procedure is to generate realizations of an image by modeling its spatial variability through the generation of multiple equiprobable stochastic realizations The approach employed for the geostatistical simulation is based on the concepts of regionalized variables and kriging formulation to create multiple textural variations of medical images Experimental results on classifying two medicalimage data sets show that the use of geostatistical simulation for extracting deeplearning features with several popular pretrained deeplearning models AlexNet ResNet and GoogLeNetInception provided better accuracy rates and more balanced results in terms of sensitivity and

for effective deepfeature extraction from medical images The proposed application of the theory of geostatistics for medical image data augmentation in deep learning is original The novelty of this

impressive performance exhibited by modern machine learning models hinges on the ability to train such models on a very large amounts of labeled data However since access to large volumes of labeled data is often limited or expensive it is desirable to alleviate this bottleneck by carefully curating the training set Optimal experimental design is a wellestablished paradigm for selecting data point to be labeled so to maximally inform the learning process Unfortunately classical theory on optimal experimental design focuses on selecting examples in order to learn underparameterized and thus noninterpolative models while modern machine learning models such as deep neural networks are overparameterized and oftentimes are trained to be interpolative As such classical experimental design methods are not applicable in many modern learning setups Indeed the predictive performance of underparameterized models tends to be variance dominated so classical experimental design focuses on variance reduction while the predictive performance of overparameterized models can also be as is shown in this paper bias dominated or of mixed nature In this paper we propose a design strategy

sensors in our lives methods for automatically detecting CHF are surprisingly scarce even in the research community We present a method for CHF detection based on heart sounds The method combines classic MachineLearning ML and endtoend Deep Learning DL The classic ML learns from expert features and the DL learns from a spectrotemporal representation of the signal The method was evaluated on recordings from subjects from six publicly available datasets and one CHF dataset that was collected for this study Using the same evaluation method as a recent PhysoNet challenge the proposed method achieved a score of which is higher than the challenges baseline method The methods aggregated accuracy is error of while the experimental results are not directly comparable this error rate is relatively close to the percentage of recordings labeled as unknown by experts Finally we identified expert features that are useful for building ML models to differentiate between CHF phases ie in the decompensated phase during hospitalization and in the recompensated phase with an accuracy of The proposed method shows promising results both for the distinction of recordings between healthy

hospitalizations',\n"," 'Current deep learning research is dominated by benchmark evaluation A method is regarded as favorable if it empirically performs well on the dedicated test set This mentality is seamlessly reflected in the resurfacing area of continual learning where consecutively arriving sets of benchmark data are investigated The core challenge is framed as protecting previously acquired representations from being catastrophically forgotten due to the iterative parameter updates However comparison of individual methods is nevertheless treated in isolation from real world application and typically judged by monitoring accumulated test set performance The closed world assumption remains predominant It is assumed that during deployment a model is guaranteed to encounter data that stems from the same distribution as used for training This poses a massive challenge as neural networks are well known to provide overconfident false predictions on unknown instances and break down in the face of corrupted data In this work we argue that notable lessons from open set recognition the identification of statistically deviating data outside of the observed dataset and the adjacent field of active learning where data is incrementally queried such that the expected performance gain is maximized are frequently overlooked in the deep learning era Based on these forgotten lessons we propose a consolidated view to bridge continual learning active learning and open set recognition in deep neural networks Our results show that this not only benefits each individual paradigm but highlights the natural synergies in a common framework We empirically demonstrate improvements when alleviating catastrophic forgetting querying data in active learning selecting task orders while exhibiting robust open world application where previously proposed methods fail',\n"," 'Channel state information CSIbased human activity recognition plays an essential role in various application domains such as security healthcare and Internet of Things Most existing CSIbased activity recognition approaches rely on manually designed features that are classified using traditional classification methods Furthermore the use of deep learning methods for CSIbased activity recognition is still at its infancy with most of the existing approaches focus on recognizing singlehuman activities The current study explores the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to recognize humantohuman interactions HHIs using CSI signals Particularly we introduce an endtoend deep learning framework that comprises three phases which are the input feature extraction and recognition phases The input phase converts the raw CSI signals into CSI images that comprise time frequency and spatial information In the feature extraction phase a novel convolutional neural network CNN is designed to automatically extract deep features from the CSI images Finally the extracted features are fed to the recognition phase to identify the class of the HHI associated with each CSI image The performance of our proposed framework is assessed using a publicly available CSI dataset that was acquired from different pairs of subjects while performing HHIs Our proposed framework achieved an average recognition accuracy of across all HHIs Moreover the experiments indicate that our proposed framework enabled significant improvements over the results achieved using three stateoftheart pretrained CNNs as well as the results obtained using four different conventional classifiers that employs traditional handcrafted features',\n"," 'This paper contributes to the study of PUFs vulnerability against modeling attacks by evaluating the security of XOR BR PUFs XOR TBR PUFs and obfuscated architectures of XOR BR PUF using a simplified mathematical model and deep learning DL techniques Obtained results show that DL modeling attacks could easily break the security of input XOR BR PUFs and input XOR TBR PUFs with modeling accuracy sim Similar attacks were executed using singlelayer neural networks NN and support vector machines SVM with polynomial kernel and the obtained results showed that single NNs failed to break the PUF security Furthermore SVM results confirmed the same modeling accuracy reported in previous research sim For the first time this research empirically shows that DL networks can be used as powerful modeling techniques against these complex PUF architectures for which previous conventional machine learning techniques had failed Furthermore a detailed scalability analysis is conducted on the DL networks with respect to PUFs stage size and complexity The analysis shows that the number of layers and hidden neurons inside every layer has a linear relationship with PUFs stage size which agrees with the theoretical findings in deep learning Consequently A new obfuscated architecture is introduced as a first step to counter DL modeling attacks and it showed significant resistance against such attacks less accuracy This research provides an important step towards prioritizing the efforts to introduce new PUF architectures that are more secure and invulnerable to modeling attacks Moreover it triggers future discussions on the removal of influential bits and the level of obfuscation needed to confirm that a specific PUF architecture is resistant against powerful DL modeling attacks',\n"," 'There are many techniques using sensors and wearable devices for detecting and monitoring patients with Parkinsons disease PD A

epistemological trends For each one we described an archetype of agronomists reasoning as well as the organizational model and performance logics that conditioned its development Our results show first that the chains of cognitive operations that make up the agronomists reasoning are different in each regime as for example the way agronomists define the design issue and how they explore

irrigation service delivery and agronomy to increase diversity in agricultural production and consumption in an environment where the cultivation of cotton had until recently been mandatory Water management in Tajikistan has largely been transferred to the community through the creation of water users associations WUAs which were established between and While all WUAs received training to improve irrigation delivery services some also received training in cultivating alternative crops and improving cultivation practices through agricultural extension services Through specific empirical analysis conducted on a primary panel dataset of farms in southern Tajikistan we identify the extent to which improvements in irrigation services and agronomy training through extension services affect decisions pertaining to cultivated areas of cotton and wheat the traditional crops and the cultivated area and number of newer highvalue crops We also examine the effect of water delivery and agricultural extension services on crop diversity and cropping intensity how often land is used in a calendar year We find that improvements in irrigation delivery services affect cultivated areas of cotton and wheat Cultivation of high value crops is significantly influenced by agricultural extension services While cropping intensity depends on water delivery services crop diversity depends on extension services From a policy perspective these results highlight the importance of agricultural programs for stimulating agricultural value added in landscapes historically characterized by limited crop choice and a collapse of the agricultural sector',\n"," 'To appraise the major research outputs of agronomic crops and cropping systems and to direct the future research priorities of

revealed that the agronomic researches at IAAS from to were concentrated mostly in onstation farm of Rampur Chitwan and found their focus on food grain crops with five major themes viz varietal evaluation crop management soil nutrient and weeds management and crop simulation modeling With the shifting of IAAS PG program from Rampur to Kirtipur in the major agronomic researches were found to

to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphonebased apps and opensource servers for rapid data collection and management A preinstalled maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants n for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in  The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date date of emergence date of first flowering anthesis grain filling and maturity Results showed that in Ethiopia early maturing varieties took days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes whereas latematuring varieties took up to days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas In Tanzania a similar trend was observed whereas in Nigeria most existing varieties took an average of days to complete their developmental stages Furthermore the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence emergence to flowering flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development The data aggregation approach using the ODK and onfarm personnel improved efficiency and convenience in data

involvement of research agronomists in a design process of agricultural systems in a water catchment area While agriculture is facing increasing challenges to meet current societal expectations several studies in agronomy have focused on the design processes that allow farmers to change their agricultural systems Most of these processes have been dedicated to designing target agricultural systems but more recently several studies have acknowledged that agroecological practices replace farmers as the actual designers of their own production systems In this context how can agronomists support such design processes How does a better understanding of these processes challenge the inputs that research agronomists can propose to support them We contribute to answering these questions by reviewing a case study of a design process supported and analyzed by research agronomists over several years This case illustrates that the design of agricultural systems is a process that exceeds invention the implementation of the initial design solutions produces information that should be used to review those same solutions in order to reach the design goal The case study shows that the design process depends on a tension between the exploration of an ambitious desirable future and its actual implementation To foster dialogue between desirable and actual we show how the researchers involved in this case provided a range of inputs that supported typical design activities grounding fostering design reasoning reinterpreting this reasoning and design strategy throughout the process

plays a pivotal role in national food security in China By a increase in rice yield will be required to meet the growing demand for food that will result from population growth The success of Chinas super hybrid rice was expected to provide an opportunity to cope with the increased demand for rice However in China the planting area of super hybrid rice is less than of the national total rice planting area and the planting area of hybrid rice has continued to decline since The decreased planting area of hybrid rice is related to the shift in rice establishment methods from manual transplanting to direct seeding and mechanical transplanting These shifts can result in increased seeding rates and reduced morphological advantages of heterosis eg reduced panicle size both of which can influence cultivar choice by rice farmers who will tend to favor cheaper inbred cultivars The shifts in rice establishment methods can also eliminate or reduce the seedling nursey period and subsequently shorten the growth duration and negatively affect the yield We anticipate that the above problems will be resolved by integrating mechanization eg designing highprecision seed sowing machines with agronomy eg improving management practices for increasing seed vigor and breeding eg developing highyielding cultivars with short growth durations This strategy also has implications for production of other crops in intensive farming systems in China and for other developing countries with ricebased intensive cropping systems',\n"," 'This editorial introduces the Special Issue

ecosystem N loss However the rates and mechanisms controlling these emissions remain unclear We tested whether changes in microbial community structure and increased rates of atmospheric N deposition could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by six fold We measured peak NOx sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions h postwetting NOx emissions remained elevated over h and increased after adding N In contrast we measured the highest nitrous oxide NO emissions within only min postwetting NO emissions decreased within h were insensitive to adding N and were among the highest reported globally Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification Nevertheless N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site While microbial communities changed after wetting these changes were not correlated with N emissions We conclude that desert soils can produce substantial NOx and NO emission pulses but that these emissions do not appear directly governed by changing microbial community characteristics or higher atmospheric N inputs These findings highlight the importance of gaseous N loss pathways from dryland ecosystems that may contribute to sustained N

maize genetics G and environmental E conditions increased productivity under highsyntheticinput conditions However novel selective pressures on the rhizobiome may have incurred undesirable tradeoffs in organic agroecosystems where plants obtain nutrients via microbially mediated processes including mineralization of organic matter Using twelve maize genotypes representing an evolutionary transect teosintes landraces inbred parents of modern elite germplasm and modern hybrids and two agricultural soils with contrasting longterm management we integrated analyses of rhizobiome community structure potential microbemicrobe interactions and Ncycling functional genes to better understand the impacts of maize evolution and soil management legacy on rhizobiome recruitment We show complex shifts in rhizobiome communities during directed evolution of maize defined as the transition from teosinte to modern hybrids with a larger effect of domestication teosinte to landraces than modern breeding inbreds to hybrids on rhizobiome structure and greater impacts of modern breeding on potential microbemicrobe interactions Rhizobiome structure was significantly correlated with plant nutrient composition Furthermore plant biomass and nutrient content were affected by G x E interactions in which teosinte and landrace genotypes had better relative performance in the organic legacy soil than

They produce energetic species eg electrons metastables as well as reactive oxygen species reactive nitrogen species UV radiations and local electric field Their interaction with a liquid such as tap water can hence change its chemical composition The resulting plasmaactivated liquid can meet many applications including medicine and agriculture Consequently a complete experimental set of analytical techniques dedicated to the characterization of long lifetime chemical species has been implemented to characterize tap water treated using cold atmospheric plasma process and intended to

mechanisms are discussed In parallel a chemical model of electrical conductivity based on Kohlrauschs law has been developed to simulate the electrical conductivity of the plasmaactivated tap water PATW Comparing its predictions with experimental measurements leads to a narrow fitting hence supporting the selfsufficiency of the experimental set Ie the fact that all long lifetime radicals of interest present in PATW are characterized Finally to evaluate the potential of cold atmospheric plasmas for agriculture applications tap water has been daily plasmatreated to irrigate lentils seeds

inorganic N net N mineralization net nitrification and NO leaching under native and exoticdominated stands exposed to rainfall manipulation plots in a Mediterraneantype shrubdominated community Increasing drought severity resulted in the accumulation of soil NH and NO with a more pronounced increase in exoticdominated plots Increased net N mineralization and net nitrification and reduced leaching losses were observed as mechanisms of inorganic N accumulation In comparison to soils under native plants soils under exotic plants had enhanced leaching losses upon soil rewetting We propose that distinct traits of exotic annual herbaceous species associated with higher N inputs faster turnover and reduced temporal uptake determine the changes in N cycling in response to droughts Severe droughts and exotic plants may produce a larger more vulnerable pool of N that is prone to losses while providing a competitive advantage to promote exotic growth in these Nlimited ecosystems',\n"," 'Hemp Cannabis sativa L is a sustainable highyielding crop that delivers valuable fibres seeds and psychoactive substances However there is a lack of field experimental data on the cultivation of hemp because its production was largely abandoned in the last century Hemp is now considered as an ideal crop to produce innovative biomaterials and in particular the dualpurpose hemp production fibre seed is now the norm in European countries driven by the shift of a rapidly expanding market for hemp seeds coupled with lower quality fibre requirements for innovative biomaterials This study brought new information on the agronomy and photosynthesis physiology for the resurging production of hemp particularly for dualpurpose production in Europe The effects of important agronomic factors ie cultivar planting density and nitrogen fertilization on the performance of the hemp crop were investigated under contrasting European environments Based on the experimental data for dualpurpose hemp production a planting density of  plants m is recommended for a monoecious cultivar that gives a long vegetative phase while leaving enough time for seed growth A nitrogen fertilization rate of kg N ha was generally sufficient in the tested environments whereas further optimization of nitrogen fertilization requires accurate and precise assessment of plant nutritional status To facilitate assessing plant nutritional status a critical nitrogen dilution curve was determined for hemp The responses of leaf photosynthesis to nitrogen content and temperature were quantified using a biochemical model of C leaf photosynthesis based on a complete set of photosynthetic measurements for hemp leaves Then by combining measurements and modelling an upscaling was made from the leaf to the canopy level to analyse hemps photosynthetic nitrogenuse efficiency NUE and wateruse efficiency WUE in response to water and nitrogen supply The effect of nitrogen supply level on hemps NUE and WUE was largely determined by its effect on canopy size or leaf area index LAI The effect of shortterm water stress on WUE and NUE was reflected in the stomatal regulation whereas longterm water stress enhanced leaf senescence reduced LAI but retained total canopy nitrogen content and thus resulted in a further increase in WUE Findings in this thesis provided an improved understanding of the agronomy and photosynthesis physiology of hemp particularly in relation to the dualpurpose production of hemp in Europe Such understanding not only provides additional evidence that hemp can be grown as a sustainable crop over a wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions but also provides essential information for parameterizing crop growth models Prospects for further research were discussed in view of using the findings in this thesis in combination with a crop growth model to develop strategies for optimization of hemp cultivation and breeding',\n"," 'The current importance of information

are plant protection products prevalently used in organic agriculture to control several plant diseases Since copper can have various negative effects on the environment the amount used should be reduced to the minimum necessary However this reduction should not lead to a loss of efficacy as otherwise the quality and quantity of the yield would be at risk During this study a copper sulfatecopper hydroxide mixture was combined with an agent for better adhesion to grapevines This was achieved by microencapsulation of the active agents into a fat matrix which resulted in the so called CuCaps Laboratory analysis of dispersibility and particle size proved that CuCaps form an applicable powder suitable for use in commercial crop protection sprayers Field experiments demonstrated that CuCaps have an equivalent effect compared to a commercially available copperbased fungicide CCF Both CuCaps and CCF were able to significantly p reduce disease severity DS on leaves and bunches in three independent years compared to an untreated control UTC This was even true if the applied amount of CuCaps was reduced by one third to kg copper per year and hectare Additionally in the particularly severe P viticola epidemic of CuCaps showed a remarkably better effect on flower clusters and bunches compared to the CCF However this effect was not statistically significant due

chemical treatments an effective strategy might be recovering adaptive resistance traits in both cultivated and wild V vinifera germplasm Considering that stilbenes represent the most important class of phytoalexins in the Vitaceae the constitutive expression and transcriptional activation of all the functional members of the stilbene synthase gene family were analysed in a group of nine grapevine genotypes following artificial infection with the oomycete Plasmopara viticola the causal agent of the disease In addition in the same genotypes we analyzed the expression of genes encoding for two transcription factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the stilbene synthase genes namely VvMYB and VvMYB and of genes encoding for chalcone synthases Results Downy mildew incidence and severity ranged from nihil to high in the grapevine genotypes considered being low to moderate in a subgroup of V vinifera genotypes The constitutive expression of the stilbene synthase genes as well as the extent of their transcriptional activation following P viticola inoculation appeared to be inversely related to the proneness to develop disease symptoms upon infection In a specular manner following P viticola inoculation all the chalcone synthase genes were upregulated in the susceptible grapevine genotypes and downregulated in the resistant ones The infection brought by P viticola appeared to elicit a coordinated and sequential transcriptional activation of distinct stilbene synthase genes subsets each of which may be regulated by a distinct and specific MYB transcription

cultivars is a promising strategy to reduce the impact of disease management Most cultivars that have been bred for resistance to downy mildew rely on resistance mediated by the Rpv R esistance to P v iticola locus However despite the extensive use of this locus little is known about the mechanism of Rpvmediated resistance Results In this study Rpvmediated defense responses were investigated in Rpv and Rpv grapevine cultivars following inoculation with two distinct P viticola isolates avrRpv and avrRpv with the latter being able to overcome Rpv resistance Based on comparative microscopic metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses our results show that the Rpvmediated resistance is associated with a defense mechanism that triggers synthesis of fungitoxic stilbenes and programmed cell

presence of haustoria which are specialized structures of parasitism developed by these fungi for the acquisition of nutrients and the delivery of effectors Detailed molecular studies of powdery mildew haustoria are scarce due mainly to difficulties in their isolation Therefore their analysis is considered an important challenge for powdery mildew research The aim of this work was to gain insights into powdery mildew biology by analysing the haustorial transcriptome of P xanthii Results Prior to RNA isolation and massivescale mRNA sequencing a flow cytometric approach was developed to isolate P xanthii haustoria free of visible contaminants Next several commercial kits were used to isolate total RNA and to construct the cDNA and Illumina libraries that were finally sequenced by the Illumina NextSeq system Using this approach the maximum amount of information from lowquality RNA that could be obtained was used to accomplish the de novo assembly of the P xanthii haustorial transcriptome The subsequent analysis of this transcriptome and comparison with the epiphytic transcriptome allowed us to identify the importance of several biological processes for haustorial cells such as protection against reactive oxygen species the acquisition of different nutrients and genetic regulation mediated by noncoding RNAs In addition we could also identify several secreted proteins expressed exclusively in haustoria such as cell adhesion proteins that have not been related to powdery mildew biology to date Conclusions This work provides a novel approach to study the molecular

'BACKGROUNDPhotoperiod signals provide important cues by which plants regulate their growth and development in response to predictable seasonal changes Phytochromes a family of red and farred light receptors play critical roles in regulating flowering time in response to changing photoperiods A previous study showed that lossoffunction mutations in either PHYB or PHYC result in large delays in heading time and in the differential regulation of a large number of genes in wheat plants grown in an inductive long day LD photoperiod RESULTSWe found that under noninductive shortday SD photoperiods phyBnull and phyCnull mutants were taller had a reduced number of tillers longer and wider leaves and headed later than wildtype WT plants The delay in heading between WT and phy mutants was greater in LD than in SD confirming the importance of PHYB and PHYC in accelerating heading date in LDs Both mutants flowered earlier in SD than LD the inverse response to that of WT plants In both SD and LD photoperiods PHYB regulated more genes than PHYC We identified subsets of differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes that were specifically regulated by PHYB and PHYC in either SD or LD photoperiods and a smaller set of genes that were regulated in both photoperiods We found that photoperiod had a contrasting effect on transcript levels of the flowering promoting genes VRNA and PPDB in phyB and phyC mutants compared to the WT CONCLUSIONSOur study confirms the major role of both PHYB and PHYC in flowering promotion in LD conditions Transcriptome characterization revealed an unexpected reversion of the wheat LD plants into SD plants in the phyBnull and phyCnull mutants and identified flowering genes showing significant interactions between phytochromes and photoperiod that may be involved in this phenomenon Our RNAseq data provides insight into light signaling pathways in inductive and noninductive photoperiods and a set of candidate

treatments strongly reduced grain numbers compared with the fully irrigated check Best performers under drought at jointing had more grain than poor performers while best performers under drought at anthesis had larger grain than poor performers Most highyielding lines were high yielding in one drought environment only However some of the bestperforming lines displayed yield potential and

across all three environments and interestingly these lines had high grain numbers Among parameters measured in leaves and grain leaf relative water content did not correlate with yield and proline was negatively correlated with yield there were small but significant relationships between leaf sugars and yield This study provides a valuable resource for further crosses and for elucidating genes

receptors complexed with the recognized pathogen effector Here we use a targeted mutagenesis approach based on the natural diversity of the Pm powdery mildew resistance alleles present in different wheat Triticum aestivum genotypes In order to understand the functional importance of the amino acid polymorphisms between the active immune receptor PMA and the inactive ancestral variant PMCS we exchanged polymorphic regions and residues in the LRR domain of PMA with the corresponding segments of PMCS These novel variants were functionally tested for recognition of the corresponding AVRPMsupAF avirulence protein in Nicotiana benthamiana We identified polymorphic residues in four regions of PMA that enhance the immune response but also residues that reduce it or result in complete loss of function We found that the identified critical residues in PMA modify its activation threshold towards different protein variants of AVRPMsupAF PMA variants with a lowered threshold gave a stronger overall response and gained an extended recognition spectrum One of these variant proteins with a single amino acid change was stably transformed into wheat where it conferred racespecific

walls of cereal grains have been extensively studied due to their role in cereal processing and to their beneficial effect on human health as dietary fiber Recently we showed that mannan in wheat Triticum aestivum grain endosperm has a linear structure of linked mannose residues The aim of this work was to study the biosynthesis and function of wheat grain mannan We showed that mannan is deposited in the endosperm early during grain development and we identified candidate mannan biosynthetic genes expressed in the endosperm The functional study in wheat was unsuccessful therefore our best candidate genes were expressed in heterologous systems The endospermspecificTaCslA gene expressed in Pichia pastoris and in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant depleted in glucomannan led to the production of wheatlike linear mannan lacking glucose residues and with moderate acetylation Therefore this gene encodes a mannan synthase and is likely responsible for the synthesis of wheat

sensing pathogens We previously cloned the wheat NLR Sr which encodes a coiledcoil CC NLR that confers resistance to the virulent wheat stem rust race Ug Here we investigated Sr signaling after Agrobacteriummediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana Expression of Sr in N benthamiana leaves triggered a mild celldeath response which is enhanced in the autoactive mutant Sr DV The Nterminal tagging of Sr with green fluorescent protein GFP blocked the induction of cell death whereas a Cterminal GFP tag did not No domain truncations of Sr generated celldeath responses as strong as the wild type but a truncation including the NBARC nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF R proteins and CED domains in combination with the DV autoactive mutation triggered cell death In addition coexpression of Sr with the matching pathogen effector protein AvrSr resulted in robust cell death and electrolyte leakage levels that were similar to autoactive Sr and significantly higher than Sr alone Coexpression of SrCCNBARC and AvrSr did not induce cell death confirming the importance of the leucinerich repeat LRR domain for AvrSr recognition These findings were confirmed through Agrobacteriummediated transient expression in barley Taken together these results implicate the CCNBARC domains of Sr in inducing cell death and the LRR domain in AvrSr recognitionFormula see text

by the scientific community are of worldwide concern Drought is a major abiotic stress that can restrict plants growth and yields thus the identification of genotypes with higher adaptability to drought stress represents one of the primary goals in breeding programs During abiotic stress metabolic adaptation is crucial for stress tolerance and accumulation of specific amino acids andor as secondary metabolites deriving from amino acid metabolism may correlate with the increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions This work focused on the metabolism of branched chainamino acids BCAAs in durum wheat and the role of branchedchain amino acid aminotransferases BCATs in stress response The role of BCATs in plant response to drought was previously proposed for Arabidopsis where the levels of BCAAs were altered at the transcriptional level under drought conditions triggering the onset of defense response metabolism However in wheat the role of BCAAs as a trigger of the onset of the drought defense response has not been elucidated A comparative genomic approach elucidated the composition of the BCAT gene family in durum wheat Here we demonstrate a tissue and developmental stage specificity of BCATs regulation in the drought response Moreover a metabolites profiling was performed on two contrasting durum wheat cultivars Colosseo and Cappelli resulting in the detection of a specific pattern of metabolites accumulated among genotypes and in particular in an enhanced BCAAs accumulation in the tolerant cv Cappelli further supporting a role of BCAAs in the drought defense response The results support the use of gene expression and target metabolomic in modern breeding to shape new cultivars more resilient to a changing climate',\n"," 'Impurities in

striiformis f sp tritici Pst is a devastating disease that causes significant global grain yield losses Yr which encodes Wheat Kinase START WKS is an effective hightemperature adultplant resistance gene and confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races We previously showed that WKS phosphorylates the thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase protein and reduces its ability to detoxify peroxides which may contribute to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ROS WKSmediated Pst resistance is accompanied by leaf chlorosis in Pstinfected regions but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive Here we show that WKS interacts with and phosphorylates PsbO an extrinsic member of photosystem II PSII to reduce photosynthesis regulate leaf chlorosis and confer Pst resistance A point mutation in PsbOA or reduction in its transcript levels by RNA interference resulted in chlorosis and reduced Pst sporulation Biochemical analyses revealed that WKS phosphorylates PsbO at two conserved amino acids involved in physical interactions with PSII and reduces the binding affinity of PsbO with PSII Presumably phosphorylated PsbO proteins dissociate from the PSII complex and then undergo rapid degradation by cysteine and aspartic proteases Taken together these results demonstrate that perturbations of wheat PsbO by point mutation or phosphorylation by WKS reduce the rate of photosynthesis and delay the growth of Pst pathogen before the induction of ROS',\n"," 'MYB superfamily is one of the most abundant families in plants which plays important roles in plant growth development and

snow removal yukiwari which was used in previous studies However snow compaction achieved a substantial reduction in volunteer potato sprouting in most of the experimental sites The sprouting of volunteer potatoes was reduced in snowcompaction blocks with soil temperatures below C For winter wheat sowing in potatowheat rotation the soil is tilled to a shallower depth than that for other crops and thus unharvested potato tubers are not pushed down during field preparation for wheat sowing Consequently even if the soil temperature drops slightly snow compaction can regulate the sprouting of volunteer potatoes Snow compaction did not exert any apparent influence on wheat growth and grain yield At some sites with a deeper snowpack development of soil frost and reduction in soil temperature did not progress with continued snow compaction owing to fallen snow We validated the usefulness of snow compaction as a countermeasure to control volunteer potatoes in snowy regions',\n"," 'Polycomb

change was observed for malts with higher amylase with or without addition of a metalloprotease Neutrase However metalloprotease addition significantly reduced both the content and molecular sizes of remaining wortsoluble starches This suggests that the effects of malt protein removal on starch degradation particularly on fermentable sugar production largely depend on malt enzyme activity especially that of amylase This provides useful information for brewers for example the fact that soluble starch molecular structure correlates significantly with fermentation efficiency gives a new

adjustment of root hydraulic conductivity Lp Plants were analyzed when they were days d old Root and cell Lp which involves AQP activity was determined through exudation and cell pressure probe measurements respectively Gene expression of AQPs was analyzed through qPCR The formation of apoplastic barriers was studied through staining of crosssections The rate of transpirational water loss per plant and unit leaf area increased in response to highPAR and decreased in response to lowPAR treatments both during day and night Hydraulic conductivity in roots decreased significantly at organ

the homo and heterotransglycosylation activities of the HvXET and HvXET xyloglucan xyloglucosyl transferases XET EC from barley Hordeum vulgare L and the visualisation of these activities in young barley roots using Alexa Fluor labelled oligosaccharides We discover that these isozymes catalyse the transglycosylation reactions with the chemically defined donor and acceptor substrates specifically with the xyloglucan donor and the pentagalacturonide alphaGalApsub acceptor the homogalacturonan pectin fragment This activity is supported by D molecular models of HvXET and HvXET with the docked XXXG donor and alphaGalApsub acceptor substrates at the to subsites in the active sites Comparative sequence analyses of barley isoforms and seedlocalised TmXET from nasturtium Tropaeolum majus L permitted the engineering of mutants of TmXET that could catalyse the heterotransglycosylation reaction with the xyloglucanalphaGalApsub substrate pair while wildtype TmXET lacked this activity Expression data obtained by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction of HvXET transcripts and a clustered heatmap of expression profiles of the gene family revealed that HvXET and HvXET coexpressed but did not share the monophyletic origin Conversely HvXET and HvXET shared this relationship when we examined the evolutionary history of glycoside hydrolase family members spanning monocots eudicots and a basal Angiosperm The discovered heterotransglycosylation activity in HvXET and HvXET with the xyloglucanalphaGalApsub substrate pair is discussed against the background of

and glucan content increased grain protein content and amylase activity Drought stress enhanced HO and heatshock protein accumulation in the two barley genotypes with the droughttolerant genotype showing higher capacity of scavenging HO and reducing misfolded protein accumulation than the droughtsusceptible genotype Moreover the droughttolerant genotype was more efficient in redistributing

tolerance of low nitrogen availability has been widely considered to be a promising approach However the molecular mechanisms of high nitrogen use efficiency or lownitrogen tolerance in crop plants are still to be elucidated including the role of long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs Results In this study we identified lncRNAs in barley Hordeum vulgare landrace B Liuzhutouzidamai of which were novel and characterised that were responsive to lownitrogen stress For functional analysis of differentiallyexpressed lncRNAs the gene ontology GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG enrichment of coexpressed and colocated proteincoding genes were analyzed and interactions with annotated coexpressed protein coding genes or micro RNAs miRNAs were further predicted Target mimicry prediction between differentiallyexpressed lncRNAs and miRNAs identified putative target mimics of lncRNAs and target miRNAs Six differentiallyexpressed lncRNAs were further validated by qPCR and one in particular showed consistent differential expression using both techniques Expression levels of most of the lncRNAs were found to be very low and this may be the reason for the apparent inconsistency

power and the availability of free satellite data In particular publicly available data from the European Space Agencys Sentinel missions have been used in various remote sensing applications However there is a lack of studies that utilize these data to assess the performance of machine learning algorithms in complex boreal landscapes In this article I compare the classification performance of four nonparametric algorithms support vector machines SVM random forests RF extreme gradient boosting Xgboost and deep learning DL The study area chosen is a complex mixeduse landscape in southcentral Sweden with eight landcover and landuse LCLU classes The satellite imagery used for the classification were multitemporal scenes from Sentinel covering spring summer autumn and winter conditions Using stratified random sampling each LCLU class was allocated samples which were divided into training and evaluation subsets Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy A twoproportion Ztest was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemars chisquare test was used to compare classwise predictions The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines  closely followed by extreme gradient boosting  random forests  and finally deep learning  The Ztest comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different On a classwise basis McNemars test results showed that of classwise predictions were significant from one another at the level or less Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel bands belonged to the red edge and shortwave infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum and were dominated by scenes from spring and summer The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning

appealing paradigm to build highquality ML models by training on the aggregated data from many parties However these parties are only willing to share their data when given enough incentives such as a

partys reward based on Shapley value and information gain on model parameters given its data Subsequently we give each party a model as a reward To formally incentivize the collaboration we define some desirable properties eg fairness and stability which are inspired by cooperative game theory but adapted for our model reward that is uniquely freely replicable Then we propose a novel model reward scheme to satisfy fairness and trade off between the desirable properties via an adjustable parameter The value of each partys model reward determined by our scheme is attained by injecting Gaussian noise to the aggregated training data with an optimized noise variance We empirically demonstrate interesting properties of our scheme and evaluate its performance using synthetic and

determining what unfairness should mean in a given context is nontrivial there are many competing definitions and choosing between them often requires a deep understanding of the underlying task It is thus tempting to use model explainability to gain insights into model fairness however existing explainability tools do not reliably indicate whether a model is indeed fair In this work we present a new approach to explaining fairness in machine learning based on the Shapley value paradigm Our fairness explanations attribute a models overall unfairness to individual input features even in cases where the model does not operate on sensitive attributes directly Moreover motivated by the linearity of Shapley explainability we propose a meta algorithm for applying existing trainingtime fairness interventions wherein one trains a perturbation to the original model rather than a new model entirely By explaining the original model the perturbation and the faircorrected model we gain insight into the accuracyfairness tradeoff that is being made by the intervention We further show that this meta algorithm enjoys both flexibility and stability benefits with no loss in performance',\n","

clinical signs including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms However traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are

banana farm production To this end data from randomly selected farm households from Pakistan were collected through a structured selfreport questionnaire Using logistic regression LR and structural equation modeling SEM socioeconomic and psychosocial effects were evaluated The results show that economic status watching agricultural training programs newspaper and radio awareness campaigns participation in extension programs perceptions of sustainable agriculture and the feasibility of SAPs were significant factors in farmers adoption of sustainable agriculture practices Also consistent with the theory of planned behavior TPB all its dimensions attitude subjective norms and perceived behavioral control affected the adoption of SAPs This finding highlights the importance of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors in promoting sustainable agricultural practice among banana production farmers This is the first study which attempts to provide empirical evidence using a robust procedure two modelsLR and SEM The practical implication is that when socioeconomic and psychosocial factors are well supported by satisfactory policy measures SAP adoption is more than likely

arsenic can result in adverse health effects for humans Gardeners may face exposure to these contaminants because of their regular contact with soil and consumption of produce grown in urban areas However there is a lack of research regarding whether differential exposure to HMM may be attributed to differential knowledge of exposure sources In industrial slag and hazardous levels of soil contamination were detected in West Atlanta We conducted communityengaged research through surveys and followup interviews to understand awareness of slag HMM in soil and potential remediation options Home gardeners were more likely to recognize HMM health effects and to cite health as a significant benefit of gardening than community gardeners In terms of knowledge participants were concerned about the potential health effects of contaminants in soil yet unconcerned with produce in their gardens Gardeners knowledge on sources of HMM exposure and methods for remediation were low and varied based on racial group View FullText',\n"," 'Waste management has become pertinent in urban regions along with rapid population growth The current ways of managing waste such as refuse collection and recycling are failing to minimise waste in cities With urban populations growing worldwide there is the challenge of increased pressure to import food from rural areas Urban agriculture not only presents an opportunity to explore other means of sustainable food production but for managing organic waste in cities However this opportunity is not taken advantage of Besides there is a challenge of mixed reactions from urban planners and policymakers concerning the challenges and benefits presented by using organic waste in urban agriculture The current paper explores the perceived challenges and opportunities for organic waste utilisation and management through urban agriculture in the Durban South Basin in eThekwini Municipality in KwaZuluNatal KZN Province of South Africa It is anticipated that this information will be of use to the eThekwini Municipality policymakers researchers urban agriculture initiatives households and relevant stakeholders in the study areas and similar contexts globally Two hundred households involved in any urban farming activity and ten key informants six staff from the Cleaning and Solid Waste Unit of the eThekwini Municipality and four from the urban agricultural initiative were selected using convenient sampling Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analysis were used to analyse data The significant perceived challenges and risks associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture included lack of a supporting policy climatic variation lack of land tenure rights soil contamination and food safety concerns Qualitative data further showed that the difficulty in segregating waste water scarcity difficulty in accessing inputs limited transportation of organic waste inadequate handling and treatment of organic waste and being a health hazard were some important challenges On the other hand the significant perceived benefits associated with the utilisation of organic waste through urban agriculture were enhanced food and nutrition security and opportunities for business incubation Other important benefits established through qualitative data were an improved market expansion for farmers and improved productivity Overall despite the perceived challenges and risks there is an opportunity to manage organic waste through urban agriculture It is imperative for an integrated policy encompassing the food climate and waste management to be developed to support this strategy All stakeholdersthe government municipal authorities and urban agricultural initiatives should also guided by the policy support urban farmers for example through pieces of training on how to properly manage and recycle organic waste land distribution inputs availability and water usage rights among other

applications Dermal uptake is a known exposure route for dichlorvos and chemical protective gloves are commonly utilized Chemical handling and application may occur in a variety of thermal environments and the rates of both chemical permeation through gloves and transdermal penetration may vary significantly with temperature There has been no published research on the temperaturedependent kinetics of these processes for dichlorvos and thus this study reports on the effects of hot conditions for the concentrated and application strength chemical Dichlorvos breakthrough times for nondisposable polyvinyl chloride PVC gloves at C were approximately halved compared to C for the concentrate vs h and more than halved at application strength vs h From permeation experiments covering  C there was a fold increase in cumulative permeation over h for the concentrated dichlorvos and the estimated activation energy halved Elevated temperature was also shown to be a significant factor for human skin penetration increasing the cumulative penetration of concentrate dichlorvos from  to  gcm p and application strength from  to  gcm p This work illustrates the important role temperature plays in glove performance and health risk via dermal exposure As such it is important to consider inuse conditions of temperature when implementing chemical

However the identity functions and the factors that influence the association of bacterial endophytes with desert plants are poorly known These bacterial endophytes can be used as an untapped resource to favor plant growth and development in agroecosystems of arid regions The present study is therefore focused on the isolation and identification of bacterial endophytes from two native medicinal plants Fagonia mollis Delile and Achillea fragrantissima Forssk Sch Bip growing spontaneously in the arid region of the South Sinai Egypt and characterization of their plant growth promoting PGP traits Thirteen putative bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaves of both plant species and characterized for their plant growth promoting abilities using molecular and biochemical approaches as well as greenhouse trials Selected endophytic bacterial strains were applied to maize plants Zea mays L var Single cross Pioneer K to further evaluate their PGP abilities under greenhouse conditions Isolated bacterial strains have variable plant growth promoting activities Among these activities isolated bacterial endophytes have the efficacy of phosphate solubilizing with clear zones ranging from  to  mm Additionally the obtained bacterial endophytes increased the productivity of indole acetic acid IAA in broth media from to gmL with increasing tryptophan concentration from to mgmL Bacillus and Brevibacillus strains were frequently isolated from the leaves of both plant species and had significant positive effects on plant growth and shoot phosphorus P and nitrogen N contents Results suggest that these endophytes are good candidates as plant growth promoting inoculants to help reduce chemical input in conventional agricultural practices and increase nutrient

majority of those transmitted by aphids to the predominance of whiteflytransmitted ones Later due to the shift towards an integrated control that has been quite successful in the control of aleyrodids not so much in the control of aphids aphidborne viruses are having a significant revival in open field cultivation Another threat is the continuous emergence of new species or variants of mechanically transmitted viruses Thus the number of viruses affecting these crops is constantly increasing and their control demands dynamic actions The main measures that have managed to limit the damage of these diseases have been the improvement in the physical barriers that limit the spread of vectors and the introduction of resistances in the germplasm Recently the increased movement of plant materials and of people the popularity of growing local crop varieties that lack natural resistances against pathogens and the prospects of global climate change may well have boosted the frequency of diseases and pests Faced with this picture strategies must be addressed from a multidisciplinary approach The need for infield diagnostics tools easy access to information novel breeding technologies and alternatives to control of these viruses are discussed View FullText',\n"," 'Steep slopes are the main cause of rollover incidents in agriculture Targeted safety signs have been developed to warn machinery operators against risky slopes However machinery users manuals and road signs report information regarding slope steepness in two different ways by using the tilt angle in degrees and the slope percentage respectively In this study we investigated the comprehension of safety signs depicting critical slopes either in degrees or as percent values in a group of Italian agricultural machinery operators while considering the possible influence of previous experience with agricultural machinery previous incidents and onfarm occupation Eighteen tractor and selfpropelled machinery operators were administered graphical representations of seven slope angles in a randomized order and then were asked to estimate the slope steepness as both a tilt angle and a slope percentage The participants tended to overestimate slope steepness in degrees whereas the opposite was true for percentages Farmers who were previously involved in a machineryrelated incident were more accurate in their estimates The present results raise some considerations regarding the need to redesign safety communication and to promote targeted training interventions View FullText',\n"," 'Autonomous mowers are becoming increasingly common in public and private greenspaces Autonomous mowers can provide several advantages since these machines help to save time and energy and prevent operators from possible injuries Current autonomous mowers operate by following random trajectories within areas defined by a shallowburied boundary wire that has the purpose to generate an electromagnetic field Once the electromagnetic field is perceived by the autonomous mower the machine will stop and change direction Mowing along random trajectories is considered an efficient solution to manage areas with a variable number of obstacles In agriculture autonomous technologies are becoming increasingly popular since they can help to increase both the quantity and quality of agricultural products by reducing productive cost and improving the production process Thus even autonomous mowers may be useful to carry out some of the agricultural operations that are highly time consuming In fact some autonomous mowers designed and realized to work in vineyards and home vegetable gardens are already available on the market The aim of this study was to compare the work capacity of six autonomous mowers that move along random trajectories in areas with a high number of obstacles to assess if these machines may be employed in some agricultural contexts The six autonomous mowers were split in three groups based on their size large medium and small and were left to work in two areas with equal number of obstacles but different layouts The first area Site A had a square shape and an extension of m in order to keep the autonomous mowers enclosed inside it The second area Site B had a square shape and an extension of m in order to have a part of the area with no obstacles The layout and the size of the two areas affected the autonomous mowers performances in different ways The six autonomous mowers working on Site A obtained similar results and higher performances compared to the same mowers working on Site B All the autonomous mowers proved to be able to mow more than of Site A after h and more than of Site A after h On Site B small size autonomous mowers obtained the best results mowing more than of the area with obstacles after h and more than of the area with obstacles after h However specific work settings allowed larger autonomous mowers to improve their

The improved temporal spatial and spectral resolution of the European Space Agency ESA launched Sentinel A B twin platform is paving the way to their popularization in precision agriculture Besides the Sentinel A B constellation technical features the openaccess nature of the information they generate and the available support software are a significant improvement for agricultural monitoring This paper was motivated by the challenges faced by researchers and agrarian institutions entering this field it aims to frame remote sensing principles and Sentinel applications in agriculture Thus we reviewed the features and uses of Sentinel in precision agriculture including abiotic and biotic stress detection and agricultural management We also compared the panoply of satellites currently in use for land remote sensing that are relevant for agriculture to the Sentinel A B constellation features Contrasted with previous satellite image systems the Sentinel A B twin platform has dramatically increased the capabilities for agricultural monitoring and crop management worldwide Regarding crop stress monitoring Sentinel capacities for abiotic and biotic stresses detection represent a great step forward in many ways though not without its limitations therefore combinations of field data and different remote sensing techniques may still be needed We conclude that

agriculture is very low It means that a lot of synthetic chemicals are wasted rather than utilized by crops This can cause more problems where the soil surface is thin and rocky like Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea This is because overly used nitrogen fertilizer can be washed into the underground water and pollute it Thus it would be important to monitor the nitrogen deficiency of crops in the field to provide the right amount of nitrogen in a timely manner so that nitrogen waste can be limited To achieve this the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI was used to monitor chlorophyll content which is tightly associated with nitrogen content in the buckwheat field The NDVI was calculated with the data obtained by a lowresolution camera mounted on an unmanned aerial

privacy challenges and most significantly the identification of malicious and compromised nodes along with a secure transmission of information between sensors cloud and base station BS The identification of malicious and compromised node among soil sensors communicating with the BS is a notable challenge in the BS to cloud communications The trust management mechanism is proposed as one of the solutions providing a lightweight approach to identify these nodes In this article we have proposed a novel trust management mechanism to identify malicious and compromised nodes by utilizing trust parameters The trust mechanism is an eventdriven process that computes trust based on the predefined time interval and utilizes the previous trust degree to develop an absolute trust degree The system also maintains the trust degree of a BS and cloud service providers using distinct approaches We have also performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism against several potential attacks In addition this research helps to create friendlier environments and efficient agricultural productions for the migration of people to the cities View

of organic agriculture products The data collected through a survey of green consumers were analyzed using explanatory factor analysis the Relative Importance Index and logistic regression The results point out eleven main factors related to the offerings on the organic agriculture market that predominantly drive green consumers purchasing decisions The Relative Importance Index identified health benefits that stem from a specific way of production as the main purchasing motive This was also confirmed by the results of logistic regression which showed that a respondent who buys organic agricultural products on a daily basis is approximately less likely to disagree with the claim that organic products are healthier than nonorganic compared to a consumer who purchases organic products several times a week or month However as these benefits cannot be empirically confirmed green consumers look for official labels on the product packaging In order to assure the product quality more than half of them find out very important information about producers whether they have a product quality certificate how many years they are engaged in production and whether they have specific product packaging The Relative Importance Index also revealed that the main purchasing barriers that consumers face are scarce offerings and an insufficient development of the distribution channel which were ranked in first and second place The price as a barrier is of less importance About of the respondents are willing to pay up to higher prices for organic food compared to conventional food

widely adapted under rainfed conditions but adoption under irrigated conditions is limited An experiment initiated in to evaluate the level of tillage and the amount of soil cover needed for conservation agriculture to work under irrigated conditions in the highlands of San Luis Potos Mexico The trial encompassed seven treatments conventional tillage two types of reduced tillage and permanent raised beds PB which are untilled with four levels of soil cover in an irrigated rotation with maize Zea mays L in the summer and fodder oats Avena sativa L in the winter Maize and oats yielded significantly more under PB than with tillage Maize yielded on average Mg ha more in PB with the hybrid used from to and Mg ha more with the hybrid used from to Permanent raised beds generated

advice as a function of sampling density at the subfield scale Consequently soilbased decisions are often made using a data limiting approach as the value proposition of soil data collection has not been well described The work presented here investigates the spatial errors of gypsum and lime recommendations based on industrystandard blanketrate and zonebased variable rate application as well as the more advanced pedometric approaches  ordinary kriging OK and regression kriging RK All methods were tested at sampling densities between  samplesha for a ha broadacre site in central NSW Australia Whilst previous work has tested the effect of sampling density on the spatial predictive performance of OK and RK here we assess prediction accuracy as the error associated with soil management decisions based on their results ie the over and underapplication error of gypsum and lime applications in conjunction with the RMSE of prediction for soil pH and exchangeable sodium percentage ESP The uncertainty of each method is also tested to observe the effect of random initialisation on predictive performance Results indicated that RK provided superior spatial predictions across all sampling densities for the application of gypsum and lime with a blanketrate application providing the worse results with over and underapplication errors exceeding t and t respectively for  cm treatment for the entire field Interestingly the spatial accuracy of amendment application increased to a sampling density of samplesha for RK with minimal improvement thereafter suggesting that meaningful soil amelioration advice can be attained proximal to this density View FullText',\n"," 'Community Supported Agriculture CSA has become an alternative approach for smallsized farmers in many

context of precision agriculture Usually these sensor nodes SNs alternate their states between periods of activation and hibernation to reduce battery usage When employing unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs to collect data from SNs distributed over a large agricultural area we must synchronize the UAV route with the activation period of each SN In this article we address the problem of optimizing the UAV path through all the SNs to reduce its flight time while also maximizing the SNs lifetime Using the concept of timeslots for time base management combined with the idea of flight prohibition list we propose an efficient algorithm for discovering and reconfiguring the activation time of the SNs Experimental results were obtained through the development of our own simulatorUAV Simulator These results demonstrate a considerable reduction in the distance traveled by the UAV and also in its flight time In addition the model provides a reduction in transmission time by SNs after reconfiguration thus ensuring a longer lifetime for the SNs in the monitoring environment as well as improving the freshness and continuity of the gathered data which support the decisionmaking

novelty of this paper compared with existing mobile gateway proposals is that we are going to test the performance of the drone that is acting as a remote sensing tool to carry a lowcost gateway node to gather the data from the nodes deployed on the field Taking this in mind simulations of different scenarios were performed to determine if the data can be transmitted correctly or not considering different flying parameters such as speed from to ms and flying height from to m and wireless sensor network parameters such as node density node each m to node each m and antenna coverage to m We have calculated the time that each node remains with connectivity and the time required to send the data to estimate if the connection will be bad good or optimal Results point out that for the

efficient use of rainwater is critical for the improvement of sustainable crop production Conservation agriculture CA has been regarded as an ideal field management strategy to profoundly benefit water use and therefore crop production However it remains unclear as to how crop production and water use respond to annual precipitation and how CA practices affect crop production through regulating water use In this study a metaanalysis based on field observations was conducted to investigate the relationship between water use and crop production The results showed that annual precipitation of mm yr is a threshold to ensure relatively high crop production and water use efficiency WUE and mm yr is the most favorable rainfall level for crop production and WUE Evapotranspiration ET was linearly related to annual precipitation except that it was not the lowest when annual rainfall mm yr Although straw mulching is more important than tillage reduction tillage reduction is still necessary to combine with straw mulching to obtain a higher production of crop Crop production ET and WUE kept increasing as experimental duration increased indicating that extending CA term is essential to further improve water use and crop production We further proposed mathematical equations to prove that the increase in transpiration plays a critical role in water use and crop production improvement WUE is not necessarily related to the increase in yield and therefore higher transpiration rather than increased WUE should be the target for crop production improvement The results also suggest that evaporation and transpiration are not presented separately which limits investigation of the effective use of water by identifying transpiration Overall annual precipitation is essential for the levels of crop production ET and WUE on the Chinese Loess Plateau Reasonable CA practices especially longterm application could improve water use and crop

WAs are less informed than farmers about the water use costs and profits In this respect the paper provides a theoretical interpretation of how different information conditions profit and cost structures contribute to affecting WAs pricing strategies and their ability to deal with some of the WFD principles The study shows that in the absence of water metering WAs can still set up incentive

we introduce an open access GISbased model to help answer selected timely questions related to the agriculture water and energy nexus in the region First the model uses spatial and tabular data to identify the location and extent of irrigated cropland Then it employs spatially explicit climatic datasets and mathematical formulation to estimate water and electricity requirements for groundwater irrigation in all identified locations Finally it evaluates selected supply options to meet the electricity demand and suggests the leastcost configuration in each location Results indicate that full irrigation in the basin requires billion million m per year This translates to GWh of electricity Fossil fuels do provide the leastcost electricity supply option due to lower capital and subsidized operating costs Hence to improve the competitiveness of renewable technologies RT ie solar a support scheme to drop the capital cost of RTs is critically needed Finally moving towards drip irrigation can lead to of water abstraction savings in the NWSAS area View FullText',\n"," 'This study examined the agriculture entrepreneurial intentions AEIs of current farmers n in Taiwan and distinguished differences between  and yearold farmers by applying the theory of planned behaviour with the extension of personality traits The results determined that the entrepreneurial commitment and communication aspects of entrepreneurial selfefficacy ESE considerably affected the conviction dimension of AEI whereas entrepreneurial commitment communication ESE entrepreneurial attitude planning ESE and neuroticism notably influenced the preparation dimension of AEI Furthermore the effects of neuroticism on entrepreneurial conviction were weaker in younger farmers than in older farmers and the effects of entrepreneurial commitment entrepreneurial attitude neuroticism and planning ESE on entrepreneurial preparation in younger farmers were different from those in older farmers Moreover

often understood from the relationship between differences of altitudespecific agroecological conditions and crop cultivation characteristics However social factors can also play a role We aimed to clarify how the cropping system is maintained through examining sociocultural factors specifically land tenure and marriage systems in an agricultural community in rural mountainous Africa Several surveys based on participatory observation accompanied by home stays were conducted to determine people who participated in cropping systems and to understand which social system maintained the cropping system We found that around of target households in Kiboguwa village cultivated three staple crops maize cassava and rice using the same cropping system and almost no farmers outside the village used the villages sloped fields meaning that the villagers maintained the cropping system Households acquired nearby sloped fields by various means such as inheriting land through maternal lineage of household heads or wives We observed virilocal and uxorilocal residence at similar degreesand if either the husband or wife was from outside the village that household would also have fields outside the village However nearly of marriages were intravillage and villagers predominantly used fields located within the village limits regardless of the residence type which helped

poor urban dwellers Urban agriculture UA seems a viable intervention to address urban food insecurity however experience has shown that urban gardens do not expand at the expected rate Tackling this issue requires a deeper understanding of the main constraints that block UA expansion Benin is not an exception the country witnesses a breathtaking growth of its main cities that is in synchronization with a mounting food insecurity Our research aims therefore to identify the main constraints for the expansion of UA in Benin and adopt a threepronged approach combined with a systematic literature review a survey held among experienced urban gardeners and indepth interviews with stakeholders Altogether the synthesis shows a predominance of five main constraints lack of land and tenure insecurity insufficient government support restricted market access limited access to productive factors and inequality issues Specifically while the review showed that most barriers are linked and could be tackled together the survey indicated a political unwillingness which in our indepth interviews is explained by the unperceived benefits of investing in UA and the lack of enforcement of urban development plans We suggest that Beninese authorities and academics move in synchronization where the former coordinates the planning of urban gardens and the latter provides evidence to trigger public and private investments in UA The findings could be the basis for further research on UA in West Africa and the wider continent View FullText',\n"," 'Each year around of the

producers especially for small size farms to sell fresh local products directly to its members CSA is an important approach to promote local economic growth and contribute to sustainable agriculture Although CSA is widely accepted across the United States the total number of CSA membership is still very low It is important to determine the factors that affect the future development of CSA because of its social and environmental benefits In this study we analyze how the motivation barriers and methods of advertisement influence the participation dynamics of CSA by segmenting consumers based on their past current and future CSA participation Based on a national survey with responses the results show that the younger generation highincome families and people who support sustainable agriculture are more likely to renew their CSA subscription CSA members are found to be very sensitive to the time of food distribution the price of products and the location of CSA farms Moreover the impacts of perceived barriers of CSA participation and advertisement method vary based on respondents membership status This paper sheds light on factors that influence various consumer groups and offers a more dynamic analysis of CSA consumer behavior This analysis enhances understanding of CSA members preferences and could help CSA programs expand in the future and to better promote local

detection and classification of plant diseases and crop pests play crucial roles in the management and decisionmaking Recently there have been many artificial neural network ANN methods used in agricultural classification tasks which are task specific and require big datasets These two characteristics are quite different from how humans learn intelligently Undoubtedly it would be exciting if the models can accumulate knowledge to handle continual tasks Towards this goal we propose an ANNbased continual classification method via memory storage and retrieval with two clear advantages Few data and high flexibility This proposed ANNbased model combines a convolutional neural network CNN and generative adversarial network GAN Through learning of the similarity between input paired data the CNN part only requires few raw data to achieve a good performance suitable for a classification task The GAN part is used to extract important information from old tasks and generate abstracted images as memory for the future task Experimental results show that the regular CNN model performs poorly on the continual tasks pest and plant classification due to the forgetting problem However our proposed method can distinguish all the categories from new and old tasks with good performance owing to its ability of accumulating knowledge and alleviating forgetting There are so many possible applications of this proposed approach in the agricultural field for instance the intelligent fruit picking robots which can recognize and pick different kinds of fruits the plant protection is achieved by automatic identification of diseases and pests which can continuously improve the detection range Thus this work also provides a reference for other studies towards more intelligent and

research shows that the uptake of these technological innovations in urban planning processes is problematic Therefore this research analyzes the barriers that local government planners and HTUA developers are facing in the embedding of HTUA in urban planning processes using the city of Amsterdam as a case study This study draws on actornetwork theory ANT to analyze the interactions between planners technologies technology developers and developers of alternative food production practices Several concepts of ANT are integrated into a multilevel perspective on sustainability transitions MLP to create a new theoretical framework that can explain how interactions between technologies and planning actors transform the incumbent socialtechnical regime The configuration of interactions between social and material entities in technology development and adoption processes in Amsterdam is analyzed through the lens of this theoretical framework The data in this study were gathered by tracing actors and their connections by using ethnographic research methods In the course of the integration of new technologies into urban planning practices gaps between technologies technology

the practical use and application of a mobile smartphonebased tool ie the Open Data Kit ODK to assemble and keep track of realtime maize Zea mays L phenological data in three SSA countries Farmers extension agents researchers and other stakeholders were enlisted to participate in an initiative to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphonebased apps and opensource servers for rapid data collection and management A preinstalled maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants n for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in  The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date date of emergence date of first flowering anthesis grain filling and maturity Results showed that in Ethiopia early maturing varieties took days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes whereas latematuring varieties took up to days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas In Tanzania a similar trend was observed whereas in Nigeria most existing varieties took an average of days to complete their developmental stages Furthermore the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence emergence to flowering flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development The data aggregation approach using the ODK and onfarm personnel improved efficiency and convenience in data collection and visualization Our study demonstrates that this system can be used in crop management and research

roots We describe and comment on different approaches to aspects of the analysis of plant roots based on images namely root segmentation ie the isolation of root from nonroot matter rootsystem reconstruction and extraction of higherlevel phenotypes As many of these approaches are novel and have yet to be applied to this context we limit ourselves to brief descriptions of the methodologies With the rapid development and growing use of Xray CT scanning technologies to generate large volumes of data relevant to root structure it is timely to review existing and potential quantitative and

required for high productivity of the maize plant In most farmers fields in SubSaharan Africa SSA there is low availability of N in the soil mainly due to continuous cultivation of the land crop residues removal little or no application of fertilizers and rapid leaching There is a need to develop low N tolerant and adapted maize genotypes Evaluation of maize genotypes under different nitrogen conditions would therefore be useful in identifying genotypes that combine stability with high yield potential for both stress and nonstress environment Eighty maize hybrids were evaluated at Mbalmayo and Nkolbisson in Cameroon during and minor and major cropping seasons across environments under low and high N conditions The objectives of the study were i to determine the effect of genotype x environment interaction G  E on grain yield and yield stability of single cross maize hybrids across low N and optimum N environments and ii to identify genotypes to recommend for further use in the breeding program Yield data of hybrids were analyzed initially and the analysis of best performing genotypes was further performed for a better visualization and interpretation of the results Combined analysis of variance showed highly significant G  E effects for grain yield The GGE biplot analysis divided the study area into three mega environments one related to the major cropping season while the two others were related to the minor cropping season The grain yield of the highest yielding hybrids ranged from to kg ha Hybrid  was the highest yielding in the minor season while the most outstanding hybrid TLA  was the best for the major season The latter hybrid showed the potential for production across environments and should therefore be further tested in multiple environments to confirm consistency of its high yield performance and stability and to facilitate its release as a commercial hybrid High yielding but not stable hybrids across environments could be recommended for the specific environments where they performed well View FullText',\n"," 'Precision agriculture PA has been used for  years to optimize inputs maximize profit and minimize negative environmental

and released around the world over the past few decades While the review points out some gaps in information or research efforts challenges associated with adoption QPM varieties are highlighted and suggestions to overcome them are presented The adoption of released varieties and challenges facing QPM production at the farmer level are also mentioned Several breeding methods have been conventionally used to develop QPM varieties in stressed drought low soil nitrogen resistance to grey leaf spot Turcicum leaf blight ear rot and Striga and nonstressed environments At least three genetic loci have been found to be implicated in controlling the levels of a protein synthesis factor correlated with lysine They have been mapped on chromosomes and While the use of molecular

breeding QPM for tolerance to environmental stresses such as low soil pH heat and combined heat and drought stress The postharvest attack of QPM grains should also be considered The adoption of QPM genotypes by farmers has been found to be limited mainly due to the minimal collaboration between maize breeders farmers agricultural extension workers and other relevant stakeholders as well as the

these amendments on plant growth may depend on physicochemical soil parameters in particular pH The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of soil pH on biomass production P use efficiency and soil P forms after P amendment application mg kg P using poultry manure compost PM rock phosphate RP and their combination PMRP We performed a growth chamber experiment with ryegrass plants Lolium perenne grown on two soil types with contrasting pH under controlled conditions for weeks Chemical P fractions biomass production and P concentrations were measured to calculate plant uptake and P use efficiency We found a strong synergistic effect on the available soil P while antagonistic effects were observed for ryegrass production and P uptake We conclude that although the combination of PM and RP has positive effects in terms of soil P availability the combined effects of the mixture must be taken into account and further evaluated for different soil types and

described by models This study provides an approach for modeling the joint impact of inorganic N and P fertilization on crop production considering the P supplied by the soil which was approximated using the soil test P STP We developed yield response models for Finnish spring barley crops Hordeum vulgare L for clay and coarsetextured soils by using existing extensive experimental datasets and nonlinear estimation techniques Model selection was based on iterative elimination from a wide diversity of plausible model formulations The CobbDouglas type model specification consisting of multiplicative elements performed well against independent validation data suggesting that the key relationships that determine crop responses are captured by the models The estimated models were extended to dynamic economic optimization of fertilization inputs According to the results a fair STP level should be maintained on both coarsetextured soils mg L a and clay soils mg L a For coarse soils a higher steadystate P fertilization rate is required kg ha a compared with clay soils kg ha a The steadystate N fertilization rate was slightly higher for clay soils kg ha a than for coarse

estimated with the help of imaging spectroscopy However recent studies have revealed that the leaf angle greatly affects the spectral reflectance of the canopy and hence imaging spectroscopy data To investigate the effects of the leaf angle on LAIsensitive narrowband vegetation indices we used both empirical measurements from field crops and modelsimulated data generated by the PROSAIL canopy reflectance model We found the relationship between vegetation indices and LAI to be notably affected especially when the leaf mean tilt angle MTA exceeded degrees Of the indices used in the study the modified soiladjusted vegetation index MSAVI was most strongly affected by leaf angles while the blue normalized difference vegetation index BNDVI the green normalized difference vegetation index GNDVI the modified simple ratio using the wavelength of nm MSR the normalized difference vegetation index NDVI and the soiladjusted vegetation index SAVI were only affected for sparse canopies LAI and MTA exceeding  Generally the effect of MTA on the vegetation indices increased as a function of decreasing LAI The leaf chlorophyll content did not affect the relationship between BNDVI MSAVI NDVI and LAI while the green atmospherically resistant index GARI GNDVI and MSR were the most strongly affected indices While the relationship between SR and LAI was somewhat affected by both MTA and the leaf chlorophyll content the simple ratio SR displayed only slight saturation with LAI regardless of MTA and the chlorophyll content The best index found in the study for LAI estimation was BNDVI although it performed robustly only for LAI and showed considerable nonlinearity Thus none of the studied indices were well suited for acrossspecies LAI estimation information on the leaf angle would be

'Crop growth in different periods influences the final yield This study started from the agronomic mechanism of yield formation and aimed to extract useful spectral characteristics in different phenological phases which could directly describe the final yield and dynamic contributions of different phases to the yield formation Hyperspectral information of the winter wheat canopy was acquired during three important phases jointing stage heading stage and grainfilling stage An enhanced D correlation spectral analysis method modified by mutual information was proposed to identify the sensitive wavebands The selected wavebands performed well with good mechanism interpretation and close correlation with important crop growth parameters and main physiological activities related to yield formation The quantitative contribution proportions of plant growth in three phases to the final yield were estimated by determining the coefficients of partial least square models based on full

grazer on seminatural and cultivated grasslands though the pasturing benefits for animals and biodiversity alike are not universally appreciated The composition of ground vegetation on pastures determines the value of both the forage for grazing animals as well as the biodiversity values for species associated with the pastoral ecosystems We studied three pastures each representing one of the management types in southern Finland latitudes  seminatural permanent and cultivated grassland All have been grazed exclusively by horses for several decades We aimed to evaluate feeding values and horses welfare on the one hand and impacts of horses on biodiversity in boreal conditions on the other Though there were differences among the pastures the nutritional value of the vegetation in all three pastures met the energy and protein needs of most horse categories through the whole grazing season Some mineral concentrations were low compared to the requirements and supplementation of Cu Zn and Na is needed to balance the mineral intake Only minor injuries or health problems were observed All metrics of biological values as well as number of species eaten by horses were particularly high in a seminatural pasture compared to other pasture types The highest ratio of species cover preferred by horses to the total cover was found in the permanent pasture while at the regularly reseeded pasture there was a particularly high cover of species indicating low biodiversity values on grassland There was therefore a tradeoff between the quantity of forage and biological values in pastures but not in quality The results provide clear indication both for the suitability of the studied pasture types to horses and for grazing of horses for biodiversity management In each pasture type specific management is needed to simultaneously achieve objectives of adequate pasturing and biodiversity The short duration only one grazing season must be considered when applying the

selenium Se and the effects of Se supplementation especially in the bovine species Selenium is an important trace element in cattle Some of its roles include the participation in the antioxidant defense the cattle farms The nutritional requirements of Se in cattle are estimated at gkg DM dry matter for beef cattle and at gkg DM for dairy cows The rations high in fermentable carbohydrates nitrates sulfates calcium or hydrogen cyanide negatively influence the organisms use of the selenium contained in the diet The Se supplementation may reduce the incidence of metritis and ovarian cysts during the postpartum period The increase in fertility when adding Se is attributed to the reduction of the embryonic death during the first month of gestation A use of organic Se in feed would provide a better transfer of Se in calves relative to mineral Se supplementation The addition of Se yeasts in the foodstuffs of cows significantly increases the Se content and the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA in milk compared to the addition of sodium selenite The enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase is a selenodependent selenoprotein It is one of the last proteins to be affected in the event of Se deficiency This delay in response could explain the fact that several studies did not show the effect of Se supplementation on growth and weight gain of calves Enrichment of Se in the diet did not significantly affect the slaughter weight and carcass yield of bulls The impact and results of Se supplementation in cattle depend on physiological stage Se status of animals type and content of Se and types of Se administration Further studies in Se supplementation should investigate the speciation of Se in food and yeasts as well as understanding their metabolism and

System Simulator APSIM modelling framework was used to determine spatial and temporal trends in postflowering frost risk The NGR could be divided into six broad subregions each delineating locations with similar frost risk The risk was nearly two to three times greater in the Southern Downs and Darling Downs subregions as compared to the Central Queensland Highlands Dawson Callide New South Wales and Northern New South WalesWestern Downs subregions There was an increasing trend in the frequency of frost events in the Southern Downs and New South Wales subregions and a decreasing trend in the Central Queensland Highlands and Dawson Callide subregions consistent with the changing climate of the NGR In each subregion frost risk declined with delayed sowings but such sowings resulted in simulation of reduced water limited yield potential unfrosted as well The model output was also used to compute and probabilities of the last day of experiencing  to C minimum temperatures and

high frost risk Simulations involving genotype x environment x management interactions suggested additional opportunities to minimise frost losses through the adoption of particular cultivars of differing phenology and the use of different agronomy in various environments of the NGR The study indicates that there is considerable variation in frost risk across the NGR and that manipulating flowering times either through time of sowing or cultivar choice could assist in minimising yield losses in chickpea due to frost View FullText',\n"," 'Clay minerals are very common in nature and

those of the biochar treatments or the mineral fertilizer control treatment The feedstock type Miscanthus or wheat significantly affected the perennial ryegrass yield No difference was observed among wheat and Miscanthus biochar while among straws Miscanthus resulted in lower perennial ryegrass productivity the higher rate of straw and biochar as soil amendments resulted in relatively high perennial ryegrass productivity The organic amendments resulted in relatively high root biomass and length The rootshoot ratio was lower in the treatments in which biochar was used whereas feedstock species and amendment rate were not statistically significant for any of the root biomass and morphometric parameters The results suggest that the use of pyrolyzed straw can be a reliable strategy instead of straw increasing ryegrass growth and productivity View FullText',\n"," 'The growing bioeconomy will require a greater supply of biomass in the future for both bioenergy and biobased products Today many bioenergy cropping systems BCS are suboptimal due to either socialecological threats or technical limitations In addition the competition for land between bioenergycrop cultivation foodcrop cultivation and biodiversity conservation is expected to increase as a result of both continuous world population growth and expected severe climate change effects This study investigates how BCS can become more socialecologically sustainable in future It brings together expert opinions from the fields of agronomy economics meteorology and geography Potential solutions to the following five main requirements for a more holistically sustainable supply of biomass are summarized i bioenergycrop cultivation should provide a beneficial socialecological contribution such as an increase in both biodiversity and landscape aesthetics ii bioenergy crops should be cultivated on marginal agricultural land so as not to compete with foodcrop production iii BCS need to be resilient in the face of projected severe climate change effects iv BCS should foster rural development and support the vast number of smallscale family farmers managing about of agricultural land and natural resources

scale is needed for the prediction of flood drought planning and management of agricultural productivity to ensure food security Recent advancement in microwave remote sensing especially after the launch of Sentinel operational satellites has enabled the scientific community to estimate soil moisture at higher spatial and temporal resolution with greater accuracy This study evaluates the potential of SentinelA satellite images to estimate soil moisture in a semiarid region Exactly at the time when satellite passes over the study area we have collected soil samples at different locations and measured the soil moisture from cm below the ground surface using ML theta probe We processed the soil samples in laboratory to obtain volumetric soil moisture using the oven dry method We found soil moisture measured from calibrated theta probe and oven dry method are in good agreement with Root Mean Square Error RMSE m m and coefficient of determination R We then processed SentinelA images and applied modified Dubois model to calculate relative permittivity of the soil from the backscatter values The volumetric soil moisture at each pixel is then calculated by applying the universal Topps model Finally we masked the pixels whose Normalised Difference Vegetation Index NDVI value is greater than to generate soil moisture map as per the Dubois NDVI criterion Our modelled soil moisture accord with the measured values with RMSE and R We found a small bias in the modelled soil moisture However this has reduced significantly after applying a bias correction based on Cumulative Distribution Function CDF matching Our approach provides a firstorder estimate of soil moisture from SentinelA images in sparsely vegetated agricultural land View FullText',\n","

microRNAs in plants Exogenous application of miPEPs increases the expression of their corresponding miRNA and consequently induces consistent phenotypical changes Therefore miPEPs carry huge potential in agronomy as gene regulators that do not require genome manipulation However to this end it is necessary to know their mode of action including where they act and how they enter the plants Here after analyzing the effect of Arabidopsis thaliana miPEPa on root and aerial part development we followed the internalization of fluorescentlabelled miPEPa into roots and compared its uptake into endocytosisaltered mutants to that observed in wildtype plants treated or not with endocytosis inhibitors The results show that entry of miPEPa involves both a passive diffusion at the root apex and endocytosisassociated internalization in the differentiation and mature zones Moreover miPEPa is unable to enter the central cylinder and does not migrate from the roots to the aerial part of the plant suggesting that miPEPs have no systemic effect View FullText',\n"," 'Evapotranspiration ET is one of the largest components of the water cycle and accurately measuring and modeling ET is

natural resource and information about surface water conditions can support a wide variety of applications including urban planning agronomy hydrology electrical power generation disaster relief ecology and preservation of natural areas Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR is recognized as an important source of data for monitoring surface water especially under inclement weather conditions and is used operationally for flood mapping applications The canopy penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is generally believed to be a doublebounce scattering mechanism between the water and emergent vegetation Recent investigations have shown that under certain conditions the SAR response signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite overpasses which can be exploited for interferometric SAR InSAR measurements to estimate changes in water levels and water topography InSAR results also suggest that coherence change detection CCD might be applied to wetland monitoring applications This study examines wetland vegetation characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multitemporal radar data The results for a threeyear period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the icesnowfree time period for the day repeat cycle of RADARSAT However open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence but also high variability of coherence and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands From this knowledge we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness backscatter intensity This product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide area With an interpretation key we have also developed it is possible to distinguish different wetland types and assess yeartoyear changes In the next few years satellite SAR systems such as the European Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission RCM will provide rapid revisit capabilities and

focused on the expression of aboveground traits with the goals of increasing yield and disease resistance decreasing height in grains and improvement of nutritional qualities The role of roots in supporting these goals has been largely ignored With the increasing need to produce more food feed fiber and fuel on less land and with fewer inputs the next advance in plant breeding must include greater consideration of roots Root traits are an untapped source of phenotypic variation that will prove essential for breeders working to increase yields and the provisioning of ecosystem services Roots are dynamic and their structure and the composition of metabolites introduced to the rhizosphere change as the plant develops and in response to environmental biotic and edaphic factors The assessment of physical qualities of root system architecture will allow breeding for desired root placement in the soil profile such as deeper roots in notill production systems plagued with drought or shallow roots systems for accessing nutrients Combining the assessment of physical characteristics with chemical traits including enzymes and organic acid production will provide a better understanding of biogeochemical mechanisms by which roots acquire resources Lastly information on the structural and elemental composition of the roots will help better predict root decomposition their contribution to soil organic carbon pools and the subsequent benefits provided to the following crop Breeding can no longer continue with a narrow focus on aboveground traits and breeding for belowground traits cannot only focus on root system architecture Incorporation of root biogeochemical traits into breeding will permit the creation of germplasm with the required traits to meet

negatively affected by agricultural management We conducted a literature review to identify which ES are supplied by kettle holes and to analyze feedbacks with agricultural management Taking Germany as a test case we also analyzed how kettle holes are addressed in policy documents and for which ES they are regulated This was done to identify the societal value officially associated with kettle holes The literature review found eight ES attributed to kettle holes of which hydrological cycle and flood control chemical condition of freshwaters nursery populations and habitats and biotic remediation of wastes were addressed most often In contrast only the provision of habitat service was addressed in German policy documents related to kettle holes We identified types of agricultural management that negatively affected the supply of ES by kettle holes in particular artificial drainage high levels of pesticide and fertilizer application and management where tillage and erosion result in elevated sediment inputs Additionally climate change may lead to an increased drying up of kettle holes Based on our finding we conclude that the intensity of agricultural management around kettle holes threatens the supply of all ES while only the service of providing habitats for biodiversity is addressed in German policy regulations Further regulation is required to induce

Pink Lemonade are valuable resources for investigating anthocyanin biosynthesis in blueberries In this study we examined expression of flavonoid pathway genes during fruit development in wildtype bluefruited blueberries using quantitative realtime PCR Expression was also compared between wildtype and the pinkfruited Pink Lemonade This revealed significantly lower expression in Pink Lemonade than in wildtype of nearly all the structural genes examined suggesting that a transcriptional regulator of the pathway was affected Hence we compared expression of three known regulatory genes and found that the gene encoding the transcription factor MYB was expressed at a significantly lower level in Pink Lemonade than in the wildtype To validate the capacity of this MYB to regulate the transcription of anthocyanin genes in blueberries a transient expression assay was conducted Results indicated MYB overexpression enhanced anthocyanin production Comparative sequence analysis between wildtype and mutant MYB variants found differences in highly conserved features suggesting a mechanistic explanation for the mutant phenotype Collectively the results presented here contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in Vaccinium View FullText',\n"," 'Grass pea Lathyrus sativus is an annual legume crop widely cultivated in South Asia and

germplasm where its genetic resources have not been surveyed before despite their potential in adaptation to environmental changes In this study we assess the genetic diversity of snake melon landraces collected from different Lebanese regions at both morphological and molecular levels Morphological characterization using a set of descriptors revealed an important phenotypic variability among the landraces studied Principle component analysis indicated that fruit hair and its consistency fruit size and skin color pattern were good criteria for discriminating among landraces Based on the scatter plot diagram landraces of snake melon formed five different groups with one being defined as typical var flexuosus Ten simple sequence repeat SSR markers were used for the molecular characterization Fiftysix different alleles were detected with an average of alleles per locus Polymorphism information content of SSR markers ranged from to average Cluster analysis based on

outcomes of recurrent herbicide selection at low rates are far less understood In this study of a herbicidesusceptible population of Lolium perenne ssp multiflorum we assessed the potential for low glufosinate rates to select for reduced susceptibility to the herbicide and crossresistance to herbicides with other modes of action Reduced susceptibility to glufosinate was detected in progeny in

published within agronomic journals there was a relationship between the record of citations of the papers and the IF of the journals particularly if the analysis is restricted to the most quoted papers in each journal I then analyzed the cases of three other wellrecognized crop scientists to check whether the findings with my results were exceptional and in the three cases results were remarkably similar Therefore it seems that the journal IF might be a valuable criterion for choosing the best journal in which to publish our best contributions only when comparing within agronomic journals but not within combinations of agronomy and plant science journals This should be also taken into account in evaluation processes when comparing scientists working in related but not identical fields',\n"," 'Whole wheat bread represents an important source of dietary fiber and micronutrients such as minerals and vitamins The decrease of daily B vitamins thiamine riboflavin and pyridoxine intake could be connected to a decrease of bread consumption and a greater consumption of refined products The aim of this work was thus to estimate the variability of thiamine riboflavin and pyridoxine concentrations in wheat and to evaluate if this variability is conserved from the grain to the bread in order to identify wheat cultivars with high nutritional potential Extraction and analysis of B vitamins by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC have been carried out for wheat cultivars bread wheat durum bread spelts grown under the same environmental conditions in nursery plots Based on grain thiamine concentration nine cultivars were selected to constitute three groups with low medium and high grain thiamine concentration and the concentration of B vitamins of their corresponding white and reconstituted flours and white and whole breads was determined Grains showed a high variability for B vitamin concentrations ranging from to g g dry matter DM for thiamine from to g g DM for riboflavin and from to g g DM for pyridoxine After milling and of thiamine riboflavin and pyridoxine were recovered in white flour compared to and in reconstituted whole wheat flour respectively After bread making the impoverishment in thiamine and pyridoxine was less pronounced in whole wheat bread  and  for thiamine and pyridoxine respectively than in white bread  and  for thiamine and pyridoxine respectively In contrast riboflavin concentration was twofold higher in bread than in white flour The genetic variability of B vitamin concentrations was conserved after milling and bread making especially for cultivars that have high B vitamin concentrations in whole flour In conclusion it appears that B vitamin concentrations of cereal products are also under genetic control and the variability in B vitamin concentrations is an important factor to take into account for wheat selection',\n"," 'The analysis of the evolution of crop yield reveals a change in grain composition increases in yield have led to a decrease in the protein to starch or oil ratios This negative relationship reflects the higher increase of C assimilation compared with N assimilation For wheat Triticum aestivum L flour protein concentration is the main quality criterion especially for bread making Therefore a critical question for the future is how to manage the relationship between yield and N concentration where the objective is to increase both the level and stability of yield and N concentration To answer these questions we need a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the variations of yield and of its composition First of all we need to analyse genetic variability in different environments that allow the identification of genetic sources of variation that can be used for breeding or in more reductionist approaches In this paper we used data from controlled environment and field experiments at canopy and plant level and at different sinksource ratios to analyse the genetic and environmental relationship between grain productivity and composition These experiments confirmed the strong negative relationship between grain yield and N concentration Postanthesis temperature and water deficit had significant effects on grain yield and protein concentration but they did not modify the negative relationship between these variables However preanthesis water deficit decreased the sinksource ratio resulting in a lower intercept while the slope was unchanged Nitrogen deficiency also modified the intercept of the negative relationship but more importantly it decreased the slope three to fourfold Thus under limiting N conditions grain N concentration is more sensitive to yield variation than under nonlimiting N conditions Genetic variation of single grain dry mass and of the sinksource ratios had similar effects to the environmental variation Three major conclusions can be drawn from these results the negative relationship between grain yield and protein concentration is primarily determined at the stem level the grain itself is more limiting for starch synthesis than for protein synthesis and overall any increase in yield is followed by an increase of N utilisation and use efficiency',\n"," 'Crop simulation models are important tools to enhance our knowledge of plant processes and responses to the environment The objective of this effort was to reevaluate the algorithms in CERESWheat that simulate grain mass and grain nitrogen concentration two primary determinants of grain enduse quality Data from two contrasting wheat Triticum aestivum L cultivars collected over three growing seasons with varying sowing dates and plant population densities were used in this study Grain mass was simulated using a sourcesink approach The source was current dry matter production and translocation of stem reserves The sink was the number of grains and a surrogate for cell division and cell expansion within each grain Cell division and expansion were functions of temperature stress term and water stress during anthesis The translocated stem reserves were a function of temperature stage of plant development and a measure of the sink demand The nitrogen concentration algorithm was modified by making the minimum stover above ground organs not including the spike nitrogen a cultivar dependent parameter which would allow more or less nitrogen available for translocation depending upon the cultivar It was assumed that there was a linear relationship between the number of aborted grains at the beginning of the linear grain filling period and the increase in grain nitrogen concentration It was further assumed that an initial grain nitrogen mass at the beginning of the linear grain filling period was equal to the initial grain mass times the simulated actual nitrogen concentration of the above ground biomass The root mean square error RMSE for grain mass for both cultivars was and mg for CERESWheat and the modified model respectively The advantage of the modified model is that it does not require a genetic coefficient to simulate grain mass as does CERESWheat The RMSE for grain nitrogen concentration for both cultivars was and mg N g DM for CERESWheat and the modified model respectively However when the mean square error was divided into systematic and unsystematic errors there were inconsistent results for grain mass and grain nitrogen concentration for the same model with different cultivars indicating a lack of plasticity of response Incorporating this plasticity into future algorithms of key plant processes and further evaluations of the modified model in other wheat growing regions should be carried out to determine the robustness of these responses',\n"," 'Effects of mineral nutrition and temperature on accumulation and composition of protein in wheat grains and on baking quality were studied under controlled environments Under a moderate temperature regimen of C days and C nights C postanthesis NPK NPK supplied by continuous drip irrigation increased the rate of protein accumulation doubled flour protein percentage and slightly increased final single kernel weight In contrast postanthesis NPK had almost no effect on rate or duration of protein accumulation or flour protein percentage under a high temperature regimen of C days and C nights C The C regimen shortened and compressed the stages of grain fill reduced the duration of dry matter accumulation and reduced single kernel weight by Rate and duration of protein accumulation in thermal time and total protein per grain at C with or without NPK were similar to that at C in the absence of postanthesis NPK Protein percentage was higher for flour from grain produced at C with or without NPK than at C in the presence of postanthesis NPK Transcript and protein profiling studies confirmed that the C regimen compressed development without disrupting coordinate synthesis of gliadins and glutenin subunits although some specific effects of NPK and temperature on relative amounts of individual gliadins and glutenins were observed Transcript levels for gliadins gliadins and high molecular weight glutenin subunits HMWGS declined at C in the absence of postanthesis NPK whereas transcript levels for low molecular weight glutenin subunits LMWGS and gliadins showed little change Twodimensional gel electrophoresis DE demonstrated that relative spot volumes for several gliadins gliadins and HMWGS were lower at C in the absence than in the presence of postanthesis NPK whereas the relative spot volume for a major LMWGS was lower in the presence of NPK Effects of temperature on relative spot volume were generally smaller than effects of NPK Compared to the C regimen in the absence of postanthesis NPK relative spot volume for some gliadins and HMWGS were higher at C with or without NPK and relative spot volume for a major LMWGS decreased at C Loaf volume was correlated with flour protein percentage regardless of temperature regimen but mixing tolerance was highest for flour from grain produced under the C regimens with NPK',\n"," 'Protein concentration and composition are key components of the enduse value for wheat Triticum aestivum L grain Although the qualitative composition of the grain is genetically determined the quantitative composition is significantly modified by growing conditions and there are important management  genotype  environment interactions We recently reported a model of grain N accumulation and partitioning for wheat grain The main assumptions made in this model are the accumulation of structuralmetabolic proteins albuminsglobulins and amphiphils is sinkdriven and is a function of temperature the accumulation of storage proteins gliadins and glutenins is supply limited on the one hand the allocation of structuralmetabolic proteins between albuminglobulin and amphiphilic protein fractions and on the other hand the allocation of storage protein between gliadin and glutenin fractions during grain growth is constant A modified version of this grain model has been coupled with a revised version of the wheat simulation model Sirius allowing us to analyze the interactions between the vegetative sources and the reproductive sinks for N at the crop level The main modifications to Sirius concerned the postanthesis N uptake and remobilisation After anthesis the potential rate of crop N uptake was assumed to decrease linearly with accumulated thermal time and the actual rate of N uptake was limited by the capacity of the stem to store accumulated N During grain filling the daily rate of N transfer to grain was calculated daily according to the current crop Nstatus The coupled model SiriusQuality simulated dynamics of total grain N and of the different grain protein fractions reasonably well At maturity measured total grain N ranged from to mg N grain and the observed and simulated total grain N were well correlated r slope with a mean error of prediction of mg N grain The simulated kinetics of crop N accumulation and stem N were closer to the observations with SiriusQuality than with Sirius in particular during the reproductive stage At maturity simulated and observed quantities of albuminsglobulins were poorly correlated r Over the experimental cases studied here the quantity of storage proteins varied more than threefold and the observed and simulated quantities of gliadins and glutenins were well correlated r and respectively The simulations of total N and storage proteins accumulation provided by SiriusQuality confirmed that accumulation of grain N is overall source rather than sinkregulated at least under nonluxury N conditions SiriusQuality provides a simple mechanistic framework that explains environmental effects on grain protein concentration and composition The next step is to incorporate genetically related model parameters that will portray genotypic differences in protein concentration and composition',\n"," 'This paper presents a framework for nutrient management that takes sustainable soil fertility environmental protection and balanced plant nutrition as starting points and integrates concepts from plant physiology soil chemistry and agronomy The framework is meant as a tool that can be applied even if no local experimental results are known Saturated soil fertility and ideal soil fertility constitute the bench marks of the framework Saturated soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil by itself does exactly satisfy the nutrient demand of a crop producing the target yield provided no nutrients get lost Ideal soil fertility is the fertility at which the soil in combination with replacement input exactly satisfies that nutrient demand Replacement input is an input equal to the quantity of nutrients removed in harvested crop Saturated soil fertility is calculated as a function of target nutrient uptake and ideal soil fertility as a function of target nutrient uptake and recovery fractions of input nutrients Because the recovery fractions are high for N low for P and medium for K the soil is relatively low in N high in P and medium in K at ideal soil fertility The supplies of N P and K to the crop by soil and replacement input together are wellbalanced The ratio of ideal soil fertility to saturated soil fertility proves to be and for N P and K respectively In case of nutrient losses the steadystate soil fertility where nutrient',\n"," 'Heat stress effects on grain dry mass and quality were studied in spring wheat genotypes Triticum aestivum L Three cultivars were chosen with respect to heat tolerance Lavett genotype selected for temperate growing conditions and two CIMMYT cultivars Ciano genotype and Attila genotype respectively heat sensitive and heat tolerant varieties for warm environments Plants were grown in pots at two different daynight temperatures and C in climatecontrolled glasshouses and exposed to a day heat shock during the grainfilling phase To investigate its effect on quality and yield the following traits were included grain dry mass flour protein concentration glutenin macro polymer GMP fraction glutenin particle size and particle size distribution The magnitude in which a heat shock during grain filling affects quality and yield depends on the heat tolerance of genotypes and the preceding ambient growth temperature As expected the responses to heat varied between and within genotypes on the one hand grain size and dry mass decreased on the other hand protein related traits were improved In genotype Lavett a negative correlation was found between flour protein concentration and grain dry mass However in genotype Attila flour protein concentration remained quite stable under a wide range of grain dry mass in response to the treatments Genotype Ciano showed an intermediate response These big differences in genotypic response do have a potential significant impact for maintaining quality under adverse conditions In all genotypes the effect of heat stress was larger when plants were grown at C compared to C especially grain dry mass was decreased while flour protein and GMP protein fraction GMP quantity as well as particle size were significantly increased The results show that genetic differences in stability of quality and yield in wheat under heat stress can be induced by a short heatshock treatment during the grainfilling phase It is concluded that an evaluation of quality and yield responses of wheat genotypes to short spells of heat could considerably be improved by a heatshock treatment during the early grainfilling phase',\n"," 'Lutein and its stereoisomer zeaxanthin are the major carotenoids of wheat grain and function as antioxidants in plants as well as in humans Dietary intake and serum levels of these xanthophylls have been correlated with a beneficial impact on the

kneading step of bread making were also determined for the varietal mix of the three cultivated wheat species For the three cultivated wheat species lutein was the major carotenoid and only traces of zeaxanthin were detected confirming previous results obtained for durum and bread wheat Lutein concentration was significantly different among the three wheat species and averaged   and  g g DM for einkorn durum and bread wheat respectively The LOX activity of the three wheat species was negatively correlated to the total carotenoid concentration and was times lower in einkorn  nkat g than in durum wheat  nkat g which was times lower than in bread wheat  nkat g The peroxidase activity was not significantly different among the three wheat species Einkorn appears to be a parent of interest for breeding since it presents a high carotenoid concentration to LOX activity ratio a selection criteria that predicts an optimal conservation of carotenoid pigments in bread Total carotenoid concentration of the bread wheat varieties was assessed spectrophotometrically after calibration against HPLC determination The results show significant varietal variation of the total carotenoid concentration ranging from  g g DM cv Panifor to  g g DM cv Apache Therefore grain selection could be used to increase the nutritional value of wheat products',\n"," 'Four trials were conducted to study the grain magnesium Mg zinc Zn and iron Fe concentrations in bread wheat Triticum aestivum L These trials used different sources of genotypes including old French landraces a worldwide germplasm collection and elite breeding lines or modern cultivars grown in different environments Mg concentration ranged from to ppm in modern material and reached ppm in some exotic genotypes There was a negative correlation between grain yield and Mg concentration but despite this dilution effect enough variability remains useful for selection purposes Analysis of variance showed high genotype effects and Spearman rank correlations indicated moderate genotype by environment G  E interactions so breeding for high Mg concentration can reasonably be envisaged Zn concentration generally ranged from to ppm but increased to ppm in some genetic resources Variation in Zn was also partly explained by a dilution effect There was a significant effect of genotype but also high G  E interactions which would make direct selection more difficult than for Mg However as Zn and Mg concentrations appeared to be positively correlated Zn concentration should respond favorably to selection for high Mg

'The decision support system for agrotechnology transfer DSSAT has been in use for the last years by researchers worldwide This package incorporates models of different crops with software that facilitates the evaluation and application of the crop models for different purposes Over the last few years it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models partly due to fact that there were different sets of computer code for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves Thus the DSSAT crop models have been redesigned and programmed to facilitate more efficient incorporation of new scientific advances applications documentation and maintenance The basis for the new DSSAT cropping system model CSM design is a modular

simulate different crops by defining species input files an interface to add individual crop models if they have the same design and interface a Weather module and a module for dealing with competition for light and water among the soil plants and atmosphere It is also designed for incorporation into various application packages ranging from those that help researchers adapt and test the CSM to those that operate the DSSATCSM to simulate production over time and space for different purposes In this paper we describe this new DSSATCSM design as well as approaches used to model the primary scientific components soil crop weather and management In addition the paper describes data requirements and methods used for model evaluation We provide an overview of the hundreds of

available data sets from longterm agricultural field experiments in Sweden topsoil C and N concentrations crop yields as well as soil type and climate data for calculating topsoil C and N mass dynamics ICBMN a simple C and N soil model available at wwwmvslusevaxtnaringolleICBMhtml was used for calculating soil organic matter balances We parameterised this model for two field trials and for specific crops using available data and educated guesses and compared the results with those obtained from the conventional approach not including humus pool C and N dynamics In spite of the corrections for bulk densities etc the soil carbon measurements were too variable for a critical model validation or a sensitive test of the effects of including pool dynamics In other words we had to rely on the model assumptions for the projections and soil data could only be used to obtain general means eg for the whole duration of the experiment We think this is a general problem not limited to this data set and model We also show at least in principle how estimates of organic N pool dynamics can be used to produce improved N balance sheets for individual crops For example the apparent N use

Overall where specified nutrient budgets covered nitrogen N phosphorus P and potassium K in cases N and P in cases N only in nine and P only in four cases The most common indicators for nutrient budgets were calculation of a balance followed by nitrate leached The method by which indicators were evaluated and presented to farmers varied Farming sectors were not equally represented with systems for the arable dairy and pig sectors the most common Farmers received a detailed interpretation of their results in two thirds of the systems most commonly related to official limits or targets Most of the systems were developed to reduce adverse environmental impacts and of the systems were considered by the respondents to have had a positive environmental impact by reducing surpluses or improving waste disposal Use of five of the systems could lead to a marketing advantage via certified produce with a recognised quality label Where factual evidence as to effectiveness was available the benefits varied between subject types nutrients energy and pesticides and between sectors Farmers responses to the systems were generally positive and they appear to be a useful way of raising awareness of environmental problems However economic issues need to be considered if the costs to the farmer outweigh the benefits uptake will not be sustained The type and nature of the interpretation is also important as the most successful IOAs in terms of continued use and interest appeared to be those where there was regular technical input from an adviser Overall IOAs could

Annex IA of the EC Nitrates Directive ie that the estuary is eutrophic or in the near future may become eutrophic Evidence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency surface water monitoring sites has revealed several tributaries of the Ythan with nitrate concentrations exceeding the maximum permitted level of mg l mg l NON and a rising trend in the main river channel There has been an approximate threefold increase in surface water nitrate concentrations since the early s to a current value of  mg l mg l NON There is separate evidence of elevated nitrate concentrations in

used and are incorporated within national action programs to combat nutrient emissions from agriculture to the environment They rely on data that are readily available at farmgate and field level and the information generated is easy to communicate to farmers and policy makers This may have contributed to high expectations on element balances as a tool for optimising agricultural nutrient use efficiency and thereby reducing nutrient losses Element balances are potentially useful as a screening tool across Europe provided the methods to calculate them are standardised their limitations and usefulness defined and appropriate target values are established by which they can be compared It is difficult to establish straightforward relationships between nutrient management surplus losses and environmental impact Simple farmgate and field balances need to be complemented by a better understanding of the processes regulating nutrient dynamics and their spatial and temporal variability Hence agronomic and environmental reference or target values need to be established for different production systems geographical areas and elements Proper instruments and tools as well as training and educational programmes have to be developed for a successful implementation',\n"," 'The determination of nutrient surplus fertiliserofftake is one of the indicators of potential losses from the agricultural system to the environment and can be applied at different geographical scales from field to regional When information is collected from individual farmers the sample size is usually small as compared to the total number of the farms in a particular area Official databases when present are more objective and contain information on all the farms in the area and as such provide information regarding the variability that exists between farms of a region A geographical information system was built using all the information available in official databases to estimate soil surface nutrient balances at a regional scale within a ha area in Northwest Italy where agriculture is very intensive The nutrient surplus was calculated for the main farm types Dairy farms showed the greatest surplus for all nutrients considered with values greater than kg ha for N and K and kg ha for P Pig livestock farms followed next with excesses greater than kg N ha kg P ha and kg K ha Cattle livestock farms showed the lowest surplus compared to the other livestock farms with values close to kg N ha kg P ha and kg K ha Farms without livestock showed the closest equilibrium between fertilisation and offtake with a surplus in N P and K equal to and kg ha respectively Despite the fact that local legislation only regulates slurry management precisely it appeared that larger surpluses could be associated to the use of solid manure Scenario analyses showed that manure exchange between farms in the area could lead to a drastic reduction in the use of mineral fertilisers but at the regional scale an acceptable surplus can only be attained for N and K while the excess of P remains a serious problem for the environment The study indicated where the lack of information appears to be more critical and suggested options for a more accurate and organised acquisition of data The results can be used for further studies for instance with the aim of estimating the fate of nutrient surplus in the soil or in the air using simulation models',\n"," 'CropSyst is a multiyear multicrop daily time step cropping systems simulation model developed to serve as an analytical tool

the inland waters and the Baltic Sea The results of a year study of three small agricultural catchments Vienziemite Berze and Mellupite and three drainage fields in these catchments indicated that the most important factors of agricultural pollution are acreage of arable crops farming practices and nutrient management In particular attention was focused on the land use as well as on the effects of the soil nutrient balance Large variations in N losses Ntot kg ha per year could be demonstrated The losses appeared to be smaller than the results under similar cropping systems and soils in the Nordic countries where the measured losses were  kg ha per year The most significant increase of nitrogen loss was associated with the large share of arable land and increased fertiliser application in Berze small catchment during the last  years The negligible increase of nitrogen leakage in Vienziemite catchment had resulted from the low input agriculture with a negative N balance The results indicate that the N balance as well as the land use play an important role in the leakage of nutrients from drainage and small catchments',\n"," 'There has recently been a strong tendency for agricultural production in periurban areas in southern Vietnam to move away from low input rice production to more intensive fruit and vegetable production often in combination with pig production The access to a market has led to increased availability of fertilisers and livestock feed in these areas which has resulted in a dramatic increase in nutrient inputs The objective of this study was to describe nutrient management on smallholder farming systems in a periurban area outside Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam Nutrient management was assessed by nutrient balances and flows and the data were gathered through interviews with local farmers and measurement of inputs and outputs Nine farms were selected containing one or more of the following production units pig crops and fish Feedstuffs and fertilisers were important sources of input of N P and K on the livestock farms On the farms without pig production ash constituted on average of all K input but for N and P fertilisers were the dominant forms of input Farmgate balances for N P and K were positive on all farms and were in the range  kg N ha per year  kg P ha per year and  kg K ha per year The different production units were poorly integrated as nutrient output from one unit seldom matched nutrient demand as estimated by nutrient output in the next unit All pig production units showed similar nutrient use efficiencies but there were large differences between the crop units varying greatly both among different crops and for the same crop among the farms The crop units were characterised by large nutrient surpluses and low nutrient efficiencies indicating a high risk for nutrient losses to the wider environment The results highlight the farmers need for better tools to optimise farm nutrient management both through better integration of the production units but especially also by improving crop nutrient use efficiency',\n"," 'For most poor countries of today using agriculture for development is widely recognized as a promising strategy Yet in these countries investment in agriculture has mostly been lagging relative to international norms and recommendations Current wisdom on how to use agriculture for development is that it requires asset building for smallholder farmers productivity growth in staple foods an agricultural transformation diversification of farming systems toward high value crops and a rural transformation value addition through rural nonfarm activities linked to agriculture This sequence has too often been hampered by extensive market and government failures We outline a theory of change where the removal of market and government failures to use this Agriculture for Development strategy can be addressed through two contrasted and complementary approaches One is from the supplyside where public and social agents governments international and bilateral development agencies NGOs donors intervene to help farmers overcome the major constraints to adoption liquidity risk information and access to markets The other is from the demandside where private agents entrepreneurs producer organizations create incentives for smallholder farmers to modernize through contracting and vertical coordination in value chains We review the extensive literature that has explored ways of using Agriculture for Development through these two approaches We conclude by noting that the supplyside approach has benefited from extensive research but met with limited success The demandside approach has promise but received insufficient attention and is in need of additional rigorous research which we outline',\n"," 'This paper explores how social impact investing SIIwhere financial investments are made with the intention to generate a beneficial and measurable social impact alongside a financial returnis influencing new forms of agricultural development particularly in subSaharan Africa The rapid growth of SII is occurring in the context of

involvement ii how is the notion of social impact defined and operationalised iii through what practices and narratives is African agriculture specifically constructed as a site for investment and iv what are the politicaleconomic implications of the resulting assemblage of actors metrics and motivations especially in terms of what and where is rendered investable We draw on a cultural political economy approach combining the core interests of political economy investigating the structures institutions and power relations of economic processes with insights from poststructuralist social science into how such economic processes take on particular meanings through historically and geographically specific practices and discourses We show that SII is driven by commercial interests shifts in investment in relation to the growth of ethical capitalism and shifts in philanthropic circles to viewing SII as a mechanism to access alternative sources of funding SII is thus not simply a tool for creating new sources of funding for existing development activities It is changing development policy and practice by bringing in new actors most notably private equity funds and institutional investors altering the nature and activities of existing actors for example encouraging philanthropic organisations to blend their activities rather than simply using investment returns to fund

sustainability goals in developing countries Over the past decade the international community has committed billions of dollars to support various practices under the banner of CSA Despite this effort however CSA adoption remains low in many contexts Lack of conceptual clarity about the range of potential farmlevel CSA practices across contexts impedes understanding of CSA adoption in developing countries Here we review relevant literature to develop a typology of farmlevel CSA practices to facilitate analyses of CSA adoption The typology consists of six categories organized from least to most resource intensive residue addition nonwoody plant cultivation assisted regeneration woody plant cultivation physical infrastructure and mixed measures We use the typology to generate and test hypotheses about CSA adoption using primary household survey data from a large aidfunded CSA intervention area in southern Malawi We then use recursive bivariate probit regression controlling for endogeneity and selection bias to estimate the effect of program participation on adoption across CSA categories We find positive and statistically significant effects of program participation on adoption of CSA practices generally with the strongest effects on resourceintensive CSA categories Results demonstrate the potential for wider application of the typology to build knowledge of the effectiveness of CSA promotion efforts across different social and environmental contexts Our findings also suggest the importance of external support for the adoption of more resourceintensive CSA

been welcomed for its potential to bring capital into long neglected rural areas but has also raised concerns over implications for customary land rights and the terms of integration of local land and labor into global supply chains In global development policy and discourse the concept of inclusive business has become central in efforts to resolve these tensions with the idea that integrating smallholders and other disadvantaged actors into partnerships with agribusiness firms can generate benefits for national economies private investors and local livelihoods Scholarly treatment of the topic has tended to be polarized into winlose narratives or points to the contingency and social differentiation of localized experiences This review paper takes a different approach exploring published evidence on the structural factors shaping agricultural value chains and their implications for social inclusion We develop a typology of seven agricultural value chains and use this to select a sample of crops in specific world regions for an analysis of how structural factors in value chain relations from crop features to market dynamics and policy drivers  affect social inclusion and exclusion Such an approach allows us to ask whether inclusive agribusiness is a realistic goal given the broader structuring of agribusiness and the global economic system Our study finds that while the characteristics of specific crops and supply chains exert a strong influence on opportunities and constraints to inclusion the overall trend is towards more exclusive agribusiness as governments scale back support to smallholders more stringent standards raise barriers to entry and firms streamline operations to enhance competitiveness This raises questions about the feasibility of this goal under the current political economic system Findings point to the need to reconsider the policy choices behind these trends and how we deploy the fiscal legislative and gatekeeper

research sites in northern Jharkhand and eastern Madhya Pradesh have seen agricultural practices shift from more diverse traditional cropping to highyielding rice over the past decade this research examines womens responses to these new NSA promotion efforts This month study employed ethnographic methods including participant observation and interviews with village women along with NGO and government workers across both sites This analysis employed an equity framework based on the decolonial concept of cognitive justice which asserts that epistemological inequity precedes socioeconomic inequities The findings suggest while all respondents reacted positively to the tenets of NSA promotion due to highyielding paddys labor requirements and cultural aspirations to maximize rice production many farmers especially those engaged in improved paddy cultivation were unable to adopt NSA practices robustly While poorer farmers not growing improved paddy were better positioned to adopt NSA many were less active in SHG activities due to structural barriers and an observed lack of cognitive justice As NSA programs are still emerging little research has detailed the ways such efforts may exacerbate or allay rural inequities This study suggests NSA could have more impact on cropping practices and nutrition outcomes if it led with an equity approach centered on cognitive

pioneering scheme of Wilford R Gardner in His solution for water movement to a plant root was analytical Since then nearly all the models calculate water flow using numerical solutions of the Richards equation These schema include a wateruptake term specifically for the distributed uptake of water from soil by the root system These models fall into two groups based on how the uptake term is handled The most common formulations called Type I have evolved from the work of Gardner Gardner WR Dynamic aspects of water availability to plants Soil Sci  and describe the microscale physics of water flow from the soil to and through the plant roots The second form Type II comprises macroscopic empirical functions that describe uptake based on responses to water potential We discuss the merits and potential of these schemes Yet models are data hungry Effective modeling requires apposite parameterisation to be effective This can require substantive empiricism Second we present new data on the functioning of rootwater uptake and transpiration by kiwifruit vines We describe new observations in the root zone obtained using arrays of time domain reflectometry TDR sensors As well we present results obtained with new methods of sapflow measurement inside the kiwifruit vines roots These reveal the uptake dynamics during partial root zone drying PRD a technique ofttouted to reduce

were cloned and sequence analysis revealed that neither lesion disrupted the integrity of any known gene The marked strains were then used to follow nodule occupancy of Trifolium alexandrinum in competition against the commercial inoculant TA under a range of experimental conditions In coinoculation experiments in sandvermiculite TA outcompeted each marked field isolate for nodule occupancy However using TAinoculated seed sown into alkaline soil containing a marked field strain it was demonstrated that by increasing the cell number of marked rhizobia in the soil and reducing the cell number of the commercial inoculant the proportion of nodules occupied by TA was reduced These studies indicate that the ability of the field isolates to dominate nodule occupancy in the alkaline field soils was most likely caused by poor commercial inoculant survival providing the advantage for naturalized soil rhizobia to initiate nodulation',\n"," 'Xylanase A from alkaliphilic Bacillus halodurans

surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed imagery is conducted A major difference between the two models is whether the soil and vegetation components of the scene are treated separately TwoSource Energy Balance TSEB approach or as a lumped composite onesource approach Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land SEBAL in the parameterization of radiative and turbulent exchanges with the overlying air Comparisons are performed using data from two largescale field experiments covering subhumid grassland Southern Great Plains and semiarid rangeland Monsoon having very different landscape properties In general there was reasonable agreement between flux output from both models versus a handful of flux tower observations However spatial intercomparisons of model output over the full modeling domains yielded relatively large discrepancies on the order of W m in sensible heat flux H that are related to land cover In particular bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas yielded the largest discrepancies with TSEB fluxes being in better agreement with tower observations Modifications to SEBAL inputs that reduced discrepancies with TSEB and observations for bare soil and shrub classes tended to increase differences for other land cover classes In particular improvements to SEBAL inputs of surface roughness for momentum tended to exacerbate errors with respect to observed fluxes These results suggest that some of the simplifying assumptions in SEBAL may not be strictly applicable over the wide range in conditions present within these landscapes An analysis of TSEB and SEBAL sensitivity to uncertainties in primary inputs indicated that errors in surface temperature or surfaceair temperature differences had the greatest impact on H estimates Inputs of secondary importance were fractional vegetation cover for TSEB while for SEBAL the selection of pixels representing wet and dry moisture endmember conditions significantly influenced flux predictions The models were also run using input fields derived from both local and remote data sources to test performance under conditions of varying ancillary data availability In this case both models performed

the roots and on malate exudation were investigated in Altolerant Shirosanjyaku SH and Alsensitive Chikushikomugi CK wheat cultivars labelled with bicarbonateC Aluminum triggered the excretion of C into the solution especially in the SH that excreted times more C than the CK The loss of radioactivity about into the solution represented a small drain in the C reserve found in the roots In the organic acid fraction within the roots malate contained the greatest amount of C and this amount decreased rapidly with time in both cultivars The disappearance of radioactivity in the malate resulted from metabolism and translocation rather than to root efflux Aluminium decreased the malate concentrations in roots of both cultivars The Alsensitive cultivar had higher concentrations of malate regardless of the presence of Al It was therefore assumed that the decrease of malate concentration in roots under Al stress did not result from the decline in malate synthesis but due to an increase in malate decomposition This response was interpreted as the result of the Alinduced stress and not as the cause of a differential Altolerance between the wheat cultivars An important component of the differential Al tolerance between SH and CK is the greater ability of the Altolerant cultivar to excrete malate from the roots which is independent of its internal concentration in the roots',\n","

'Data augmentation which is the process for creating alternative copies of each sample in a small training data set is important for extracting deeplearning features for medical image classification problems However data augmentation has not been well explored and existing methods are heuristic In this paper a geostatistical simulation of images is introduced as a data augmentation approach for extracting deeplearning features from medical images that are characterized with texture The stochastic simulation procedure is to generate realizations of an image by modeling its spatial variability through the generation of multiple equiprobable stochastic realizations The approach employed for the geostatistical simulation is based on the concepts of regionalized variables and kriging formulation to create multiple textural variations of medical images Experimental results on classifying two medicalimage data sets show that the use of geostatistical simulation for extracting deeplearning features with several popular pretrained deeplearning models AlexNet ResNet and GoogLeNetInception provided better accuracy rates and more balanced results in terms of sensitivity and

for effective deepfeature extraction from medical images The proposed application of the theory of geostatistics for medical image data augmentation in deep learning is original The novelty of this

impressive performance exhibited by modern machine learning models hinges on the ability to train such models on a very large amounts of labeled data However since access to large volumes of labeled data is often limited or expensive it is desirable to alleviate this bottleneck by carefully curating the training set Optimal experimental design is a wellestablished paradigm for selecting data point to be labeled so to maximally inform the learning process Unfortunately classical theory on optimal experimental design focuses on selecting examples in order to learn underparameterized and thus noninterpolative models while modern machine learning models such as deep neural networks are overparameterized and oftentimes are trained to be interpolative As such classical experimental design methods are not applicable in many modern learning setups Indeed the predictive performance of underparameterized models tends to be variance dominated so classical experimental design focuses on variance reduction while the predictive performance of overparameterized models can also be as is shown in this paper bias dominated or of mixed nature In this paper we propose a design strategy that is well suited for overparameterized regression and interpolation and we demonstrate the applicability of our method in the context of deep learning by proposing a new algorithm for singleshot

is seamlessly reflected in the resurfacing area of continual learning where consecutively arriving sets of benchmark data are investigated The core challenge is framed as protecting previously

application and typically judged by monitoring accumulated test set performance The closed world assumption remains predominant It is assumed that during deployment a model is guaranteed to encounter data that stems from the same distribution as used for training This poses a massive challenge as neural networks are well known to provide overconfident false predictions on unknown instances and break down in the face of corrupted data In this work we argue that notable lessons from open set recognition the identification of statistically deviating data outside of the observed dataset and the adjacent field of active learning where data is incrementally queried such that the expected performance gain is maximized are frequently overlooked in the deep learning era Based on these forgotten lessons we propose a consolidated view to bridge continual learning active learning and open set recognition in deep neural networks Our results show that this not only benefits each individual

patterns to their roots will shed light on conditions of their development and provide a better understanding of how new agronomic approaches emerge To do so we coupled a genealogical approach with a characterization of design regimes Our work is based on a body of published work by French agronomists from the th century to the th selected for their designoriented nature Applying an analytical framework built on design theory we characterized five archetypical design regimes that emerged in connection with developments in the organization of agricultural RD and shifts in agronomys epistemological trends For each one we described an archetype of agronomists reasoning as well as the organizational model and performance logics that conditioned its development Our results show first that the chains of cognitive operations that make up the agronomists reasoning are different in each regime as for example the way agronomists define the design issue and how they explore innovative concepts Second our analysis shows that each reasoning pattern generates a specific kind of output which offer farmers different action capabilities for example action rules that farmers simply apply or design support tools to help farmers design techniques themselves Comparing the design regimes we identified four factors that influenced agronomists design explorations i their

to demonstrate the applicability of mobile smartphonebased apps and opensource servers for rapid data collection and management A preinstalled maize phenology data application based on the ODK architecture was provided to the participants n for maize data collection and management over the maize growing season period in  The application structure was custom designed based on maize developmental stages such as planting date date of emergence date of first flowering anthesis grain filling and maturity Results showed that in Ethiopia early maturing varieties took days from sowing to maturity in low altitudes whereas latematuring varieties took up to days to complete developmental stages in high altitude areas In Tanzania a similar trend was observed whereas in Nigeria most existing varieties took an average of days to complete their developmental stages Furthermore the data showed that the durations from sowing to emergence emergence to flowering flowering to maturity were mainly dependent on temperature The values of growing degree for each phase of development obtained from different planting dates were almost constant for each maize variety which showed that temperature and planting time are the main elements affecting the rate of maize development The data aggregation approach using the ODK and onfarm personnel improved efficiency and convenience in data

involvement of research agronomists in a design process of agricultural systems in a water catchment area While agriculture is facing increasing challenges to meet current societal expectations several studies in agronomy have focused on the design processes that allow farmers to change their agricultural systems Most of these processes have been dedicated to designing target agricultural systems but more recently several studies have acknowledged that agroecological practices replace farmers as the actual designers of their own production systems In this context how can agronomists support such design processes How does a better understanding of these processes challenge the inputs that research agronomists can propose to support them We contribute to answering these questions by reviewing a case study of a design process supported and analyzed by research agronomists over several years This case illustrates that the design of agricultural systems is a process that exceeds invention the implementation of the initial design solutions produces information that should be used to review those same solutions in order to reach the design goal The case study shows that the design process depends on a tension between the exploration of an ambitious desirable future and its actual implementation To foster dialogue between desirable and actual we show how the researchers involved in this case provided a range of inputs that supported typical design activities grounding fostering design reasoning reinterpreting this reasoning and design strategy throughout the process

plays a pivotal role in national food security in China By a increase in rice yield will be required to meet the growing demand for food that will result from population growth The success of Chinas super hybrid rice was expected to provide an opportunity to cope with the increased demand for rice However in China the planting area of super hybrid rice is less than of the national total rice planting area and the planting area of hybrid rice has continued to decline since The decreased planting area of hybrid rice is related to the shift in rice establishment methods from manual transplanting to direct seeding and mechanical transplanting These shifts can result in increased seeding rates and reduced morphological advantages of heterosis eg reduced panicle size both of which can influence cultivar choice by rice farmers who will tend to favor cheaper inbred cultivars The shifts in rice establishment methods can also eliminate or reduce the seedling nursey period and subsequently shorten the growth duration and negatively affect the yield We anticipate that the above problems will be resolved by integrating mechanization eg designing highprecision seed sowing machines with agronomy eg improving management practices for increasing seed vigor and breeding eg developing highyielding cultivars with short growth durations This strategy also has implications for

could explain N emissions at two desert sites differing in atmospheric N deposition by six fold We measured peak NOx sum of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions h postwetting NOx emissions remained elevated over h and increased after adding N In contrast we measured the highest nitrous oxide NO emissions within only min postwetting NO emissions decreased within h were insensitive to adding N and were among the highest reported globally Microbial communities at the high N deposition site were less diverse with higher S nitrifier and bacterial amoA gene abundances relative to the low N deposition site suggesting an increased capacity for nitrification Nevertheless N emissions were lower at the high N deposition site While microbial communities changed after wetting these

environment human health and safety and the economy Although various dust suppression methods have been used for decades some critical drawbacks in stateoftheart technology still remain unsolved such as shortlasting ground water impact and prone to water This work reports a soil stabilizer based on nontoxic material and forms a ductile and durable doublenetwork in soil namely D soil stabilizer which not only improves soil mechanical toughness of surface soil but also suppresses dust generation A copolymer comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic components combined with enzymeinduced carbonate precipitation is utilized as an insitu gelation binder to soil particle The tunable hydrophobictohydrophilic component ratio minimizes undesirable soil matrix expansion and mechanical strength loss upon experiencing wetdry processes while still retains good water affinity We further demonstrated controllable treatment depth by finetuning precursor composition which is essential to minimize environmental impact The doublenetwork morphology with carbonate precipitate embedded uniformly in polymer matrix is observed via microscopic imaging The nature of outstanding ductility high durability against water and good longterm stability were supported by systematic unconfined compressive strength UCS measurements on treated soil which show strong interparticles binding good

threatened by climate change and exotic annual species jeopardizing the native communities and their global biodiversity In these systems soil nitrogen N limits net primary production and its availability can be influenced by both of these stressors To understand the interactive effects of droughts and exotic herbaceous species on soil N we monitored the temporal variability of soil inorganic N net N mineralization net nitrification and NO leaching under native and exoticdominated stands exposed to rainfall manipulation plots in a Mediterraneantype shrubdominated community Increasing drought severity resulted in the accumulation of soil NH and NO with a more pronounced increase in exoticdominated plots Increased net N mineralization and net nitrification and reduced leaching losses were observed as mechanisms of inorganic N accumulation In comparison to soils under native plants soils under exotic plants had enhanced leaching losses upon soil rewetting We propose that distinct traits of exotic annual herbaceous species associated with higher N inputs faster turnover and reduced temporal uptake determine the changes in N cycling in response to droughts Severe droughts and exotic plants may produce a larger more vulnerable pool of N that is prone to losses while providing a competitive advantage to promote exotic growth in these Nlimited ecosystems',\n"," 'Hemp Cannabis sativa L is a sustainable highyielding crop that delivers valuable fibres seeds and psychoactive substances However there is a lack of field experimental data on the cultivation of hemp because its production was largely abandoned in the last century Hemp is now considered as an ideal crop to produce innovative biomaterials and in particular the dualpurpose hemp production fibre seed is now the norm in European countries driven by the shift of a rapidly expanding market for hemp seeds coupled with lower quality fibre requirements for innovative biomaterials This study brought new information on the agronomy and photosynthesis physiology for the resurging production of hemp particularly for dualpurpose production in Europe The effects of important agronomic factors ie cultivar planting density and nitrogen fertilization on the performance of the hemp crop were investigated under contrasting European environments Based on the experimental data for dualpurpose hemp production a planting density of  plants m is recommended for a monoecious cultivar that gives a long vegetative phase while leaving enough time for seed growth A nitrogen fertilization rate of kg N ha was generally sufficient in the tested environments whereas further optimization of nitrogen fertilization requires accurate and precise assessment of plant nutritional status To facilitate assessing plant nutritional status a critical nitrogen dilution curve was determined for hemp The responses of leaf photosynthesis to nitrogen content and temperature were quantified using a biochemical model of C leaf photosynthesis based on a complete set of photosynthetic measurements for hemp leaves Then by combining measurements and modelling an upscaling was made from the leaf to the canopy level to analyse hemps photosynthetic nitrogenuse efficiency NUE and wateruse efficiency WUE in response to water and nitrogen supply The effect of nitrogen supply level on hemps NUE and WUE was largely determined by its effect on canopy size or leaf area index LAI The effect of shortterm water stress on WUE and NUE was reflected in the stomatal regulation whereas longterm water stress enhanced leaf senescence reduced LAI but retained total canopy nitrogen content and thus resulted in a further increase in WUE Findings in this thesis provided an improved understanding of the agronomy and photosynthesis physiology of hemp particularly in relation to the dualpurpose production of hemp in Europe Such understanding not only provides additional evidence that hemp can be grown as a sustainable crop over a wide range of climatic and agronomic conditions but also provides essential information for parameterizing crop growth models Prospects for further research were discussed in view of using the findings in this thesis in combination with a crop growth model to develop strategies for optimization of hemp cultivation and breeding',\n"," 'The current importance of information

mapping populations with differently sized HS introgressions revealed severely reduced interspecific recombination in the region of the introgressed segment preventing precise localization of the gene

chemical treatments an effective strategy might be recovering adaptive resistance traits in both cultivated and wild V vinifera germplasm Considering that stilbenes represent the most important class of phytoalexins in the Vitaceae the constitutive expression and transcriptional activation of all the functional members of the stilbene synthase gene family were analysed in a group of nine grapevine genotypes following artificial infection with the oomycete Plasmopara viticola the causal agent of the disease In addition in the same genotypes we analyzed the expression of genes encoding for two transcription factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the stilbene synthase genes namely VvMYB and VvMYB and of genes encoding for chalcone synthases Results Downy mildew incidence and severity ranged from nihil to high in the grapevine genotypes considered being low to moderate in a subgroup of V vinifera genotypes The constitutive expression of the stilbene synthase genes as well as the extent of their transcriptional activation following P viticola inoculation appeared to be inversely related to the proneness to develop disease symptoms upon infection In a specular manner following P viticola inoculation all the chalcone synthase genes were upregulated in the susceptible grapevine genotypes and downregulated in the resistant ones The infection brought by P viticola appeared to elicit a coordinated and sequential transcriptional activation of distinct stilbene synthase genes subsets each of which may be regulated by a distinct and specific MYB transcription factor Conclusions The present results suggest that the induction of stilbene biosynthesis may contribute to the basal immunity against the downy mildew of grapevine thus representing an adaptive

both SD and LD photoperiods PHYB regulated more genes than PHYC We identified subsets of differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes that were specifically regulated by PHYB and PHYC in either SD or LD photoperiods and a smaller set of genes that were regulated in both photoperiods We found that photoperiod had a contrasting effect on transcript levels of the flowering promoting

climate change on the WF of wheat production within Zimbabwe Despite this relevant global and regional studies suggest that climate change will likely result in a higher WF in Zimbabwe as well as at the global and regional level These impacts will be due to reductions in wheat yields and increases in crop water requirements due to high temperatures despite the CO fertilization effect The

anthesis had larger grain than poor performers Most highyielding lines were high yielding in one drought environment only However some of the bestperforming lines displayed yield potential and resilience across two environments lines particularly for yield under wellwatered and drought at jointing where yield was most related to grain numbers Strikingly only three lines were high yielding across all three environments and interestingly these lines had high grain numbers Among parameters measured in leaves and grain leaf relative water content did not correlate with yield and proline

climatic factors for two distinct wheat cultivars Paragon and Gladius as a basis to improve predictions for climate change scenarios The two cultivars were grown in controlled climate chambers in a fully factorial setup of atmospheric COsub concentration growth temperature and watering regime The cultivars differed considerably in their developmental rate response pattern and the parameters

The development of improved plant nucleotidebinding leucinerich repeat LRR immune receptors NLRs has mostly been based on random mutagenesis or on structural information available for specific receptors complexed with the recognized pathogen effector Here we use a targeted mutagenesis approach based on the natural diversity of the Pm powdery mildew resistance alleles present in different wheat Triticum aestivum genotypes In order to understand the functional importance of the amino acid polymorphisms between the active immune receptor PMA and the inactive ancestral variant PMCS we exchanged polymorphic regions and residues in the LRR domain of PMA with the corresponding segments of PMCS These novel variants were functionally tested for recognition of the corresponding AVRPMsupAF avirulence protein in Nicotiana benthamiana We identified polymorphic residues in four regions of PMA that enhance the immune response but also residues that reduce it or result in complete loss of function We found that the identified critical residues in PMA modify its activation threshold towards different protein variants of AVRPMsupAF PMA variants with a lowered threshold gave a stronger overall response and gained an extended recognition spectrum One of these variant proteins with a single amino acid change was stably transformed into wheat where it conferred racespecific resistance to mildew This is a proof of concept that improved PMA variants with an enlarged recognition spectrum can be engineered based on natural diversity by exchanging single or multiple residues

Agrobacteriummediated transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana Expression of Sr in N benthamiana leaves triggered a mild celldeath response which is enhanced in the autoactive mutant Sr DV The Nterminal tagging of Sr with green fluorescent protein GFP blocked the induction of cell death whereas a Cterminal GFP tag did not No domain truncations of Sr generated celldeath responses as strong as the wild type but a truncation including the NBARC nucleotide binding adaptor shared by APAF R proteins and CED domains in combination with the DV autoactive mutation triggered cell death In

secondary metabolites deriving from amino acid metabolism may correlate with the increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions This work focused on the metabolism of branched chainamino acids BCAAs in durum wheat and the role of branchedchain amino acid aminotransferases BCATs in stress response The role of BCATs in plant response to drought was previously proposed for Arabidopsis where the levels of BCAAs were altered at the transcriptional level under drought conditions triggering the onset of defense response metabolism However in wheat the role of BCAAs as a trigger of the onset of the drought defense response has not been elucidated A comparative genomic approach elucidated the composition of the BCAT gene family in durum wheat Here we demonstrate a tissue and developmental stage specificity of BCATs regulation in the drought response Moreover a metabolites profiling was performed on two contrasting durum wheat cultivars Colosseo and Cappelli resulting in the detection of a specific pattern of metabolites accumulated among genotypes and in particular in an enhanced BCAAs accumulation in the tolerant cv Cappelli further supporting a role of BCAAs in the

stability Methods Field laboratory mathematical statistics Results A different but reliable level of influence on the yield of bread winter wheat genotypes of such factors as conditions of the year of cultivation predecessors sowing date and genotype was revealed Significant differences were noted in the response of the studied genotypes to the sowing date after different predecessors Relatively less influence of the predecessors on the yield of the varieties Estafeta Myronivska and Vezha Myronivska was revealed more  for the varieties MIP Darunok MIP Kniazhna and MIP Vyshyvanka The sowing dates had less influence on the yield of the varieties MIP Fortuna MIP Vyshyvanka and Trudivnytsia Myronivska A general tendency for decrease in the average annual yield was established in the

snow removal yukiwari which was used in previous studies However snow compaction achieved a substantial reduction in volunteer potato sprouting in most of the experimental sites The sprouting of volunteer potatoes was reduced in snowcompaction blocks with soil temperatures below C For winter wheat sowing in potatowheat rotation the soil is tilled to a shallower depth than that for other crops and thus unharvested potato tubers are not pushed down during field preparation for wheat sowing Consequently even if the soil temperature drops slightly snow compaction can regulate the sprouting of volunteer potatoes Snow compaction did not exert any apparent influence on wheat growth and grain yield At some sites with a deeper snowpack development of soil frost and reduction in soil temperature did not progress with continued snow compaction owing to fallen snow We validated the usefulness of snow compaction as a countermeasure to control volunteer potatoes in snowy regions',\n"," 'Polycomb

powerful and informative tool for discovering and studying functions of genes controlling environmental adaptability and nutritional value Tetraploid wheat species such as emmer wheat and Timopheevi wheat are the oldest cereal crops cultivated in various world areas long before the Christian era Nowadays these hulled wheat species are gaining new interest as donors for gene pools responsible for the improved grain yield and quality tolerance for abiotic and biotic stress resistance to pests and disease The establishing of efficient gene transfer techniques for emmer and Timopheevi wheat may help in creation of modern polyploid wheat varieties Results In the present study we describe a robust protocol for the production of fertile transgenic plants of cultivated emmer wheat Russian cv Runo using a biolistic delivery of a plasmid encoding the gene of green fluorescent protein GFP and an herbicide resistance gene BAR Both the origin of target tissues mature or immature embryos and the type of morphogenic calli white or translucent influenced the efficiency of stable transgenic plant production in emmer wheat The bombardment of nodular white compact calluses is a major factor allowed to achieve the highest transformation efficiency of emmer wheat on average confirmed by fluorescence PCR and Southern blot In the absence of donor plants for isolation of immature embryos mature embryoderived calluses could be used as alternative tissues for recovering transgenic emmer plants with a frequency of The biolistic procedure based on the bombardment of immature embryoderived

introgression based on the identitybydescent analysis Overall introgression frequency positively correlated with recombination rate with a high incidence of introgression at the ends of chromosomes and low in the pericentromeric regions and was negatively related to sequence divergence between the parental genomes Reduced introgression in the pericentromeric lowrecombining regions spans nearly of each chromosome arm suggestive of the polygenic nature of introgression barriers that could be associated with multilocus negative epistasis between the alleles of wild and cultivated wheat On the contrary negative selection against the wild allele of Tg controlling freethreshing trait and located in the highrecombining chromosomal region led to reduced introgression only within  Mbp region

substrates demonstrates the probiotic specificity of GOS metabolism Increased antimicrobial activities were observed in Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis Lactobacillus reuteri and Pediococcus acidilactici grown in media with GOS as the sole carbon source over glucose GOS enabled sustained L lactis subsp lactis growth in the exponential phase resulting in an approximately increase in nisin

protein Summary Networks of transcription factors regulate diverse physiological processes in plants to ensure that plants respond to abiotic stresses rapidly and efficiently In this study expression of two DREBCBF genes TaDREB and TaCBFL was modulated in transgenic wheat and barley by using stressresponsive promoters HDZI and HDZI The promoters were derived from the durum wheat genes encoding the gammaclade TFs of the HDZip class I subfamily The activities of tested promoters were induced by drought and cold in leaves of both transgenic species Differences in sensitivity of promoters to drought strength were dependent on drought tolerance levels of cultivars used for generation of transgenic lines Expression of the DREBCBF genes under both promoters improved drought and frost tolerance of transgenic barley and frost tolerance of transgenic wheat seedlings Expression levels of the putative TaCBFL downstream genes in leaves of transgenic wheat seedlings were upregulated under severe drought and up or downregulated under frost compared to those of control seedlings The application of TaCBFL driven by the HDZI promoter led to the significant increase of the grain yield of transgenic wheat compared to that of the control wildtype plants when severe drought was applied during flowering although no yield improvements were observed when plants grew under wellwatered conditions or moderate drought Our findings suggest that the studied HDZI promoters combined with the DREBCBF factors could be used in transgenic cereal plants for improvement of abiotic stress

explain the environmental drivers of phenology Photoperiod and temperature are major environmental cues for expression of crop developmental genes and sensitivity to photoperiod is thought to be the major cause of maturity differences among Australian spring barley varieties However temperature and photoperiod show similar seasonal trends and strong autocorrelation makes it difficult to distinguish their relative importance in crop development Partial Least Squares regression PLS was developed to handle large data sets with many correlated explanatory variables and only one dependent

convolution is used to enhance symptomatic features The IFS with nonlinear interpolation functions is then used to reconstruct the D feature patterns These reconstructed patterns are selfaffine in the same class and thus help distinguish normal subjects from those with lung diseases The accuracy rate is thus improved Pooling is performed to reduce the dimensions of the feature patterns and speed up complex computations A gray relational analysisbased classifier is used to identify the possible classes of the signs and symptoms of lung diseases For digital CXR images in AP view the proposed multilayer machine learning classifier with kfold crossvalidation presents promising results in screening lung diseases and improving screening accuracy rate relative to traditional methods The proposed classifier is evaluated in terms of recall precision accuracy and F score',\n"," 'Machine learning can precisely identify different cancer tumors at any stage by classifying cancerous and healthy samples based on their genomic profile We have developed novel methods of MLAC Machine Learning Against Cancer achieving perfect results with perfect precision sensitivity and specificity We have used the whole genome sequencing data acquired by nextgeneration RNA sequencing techniques in The Cancer Genome Atlas and GenotypeTissue Expression projects for cancerous and healthy tissues respectively Moreover we have shown that unsupervised machine learning clustering has great potential to be used for cancer diagnosis Indeed a creative way to work with data and general algorithms has resulted in perfect classification ie all precision sensitivity and specificity are equal to for most of the different tumor types even with a modest amount of data and the same method works well on a series of cancers and results in great clustering of cancerous and healthy samples too Our system can be used in practice because once the classifier is trained it can be used to classify any new sample of new potential patients One advantage of our work is that the aforementioned perfect precision and recall are obtained on samples of all stages including very early stages of cancer therefore it is a promising tool for diagnosis of cancers in early stages Another advantage of our novel model is that it works with normalized values of RNA sequencing data hence peoples private sensitive medical data will remain hidden protected and safe This type of analysis will be widespread and economical in the future and people can even learn to receive their RNA sequencing data and do their own preliminary cancer studies themselves which have the potential to help the healthcare systems It is a great step forward toward good health that is the main base of sustainable societies',\n"," 'Machine learning has the potential to fuel further advances in data science but it is greatly hindered by an ad hoc design process poor data hygiene and a lack of statistical rigor in model evaluation Recently these issues have begun to attract more attention as they have caused public and embarrassing issues in research and development Drawing from our experience as machine learning researchers we follow the machine learning process from algorithm design to data collection to model evaluation drawing attention to common pitfalls and providing practical recommendations for

prediction quality of a machine learning model In the case of Extreme Learning Machines ELM most methods proposed in the literature make strong assumptions on the data ignore the randomness of input weights or neglect the bias contribution in confidence interval estimations This paper presents novel estimations that overcome these constraints and improve the understanding of ELM variability Analytical derivations are provided under general assumptions supporting the identification and the interpretation of the contribution of different variability sources Under both homoskedasticity and heteroskedasticity several variance estimates are proposed investigated and numerically tested showing their effectiveness in replicating the expected variance behaviours Finally the feasibility of confidence intervals estimation is discussed by adopting a critical approach hence raising the awareness of ELM users concerning some of their pitfalls The paper is accompanied with a scikitlearn compatible Python library enabling efficient computation of all estimates discussed herein',\n"," 'The current practice of manually processing features for highdimensional and heterogeneous aviation data is laborintensive does not scale well to new problems and is prone to information loss affecting the effectiveness and maintainability of machine learning ML procedures This research explored an unsupervised learning method autoencoder to extract effective features for aviation machine learning problems The study explored variants of autoencoders with the aim of forcing the learned representations of the input to assume useful properties A flight track anomaly detection autoencoder was developed to demonstrate the versatility of the technique The research results show that the autoencoder can not only automatically extract effective features for the flight track data but also efficiently deep clean data thereby reducing the workload of data scientists Moreover the research leveraged transfer learning to efficiently train models for multiple airports Transfer learning can reduce model training times from days to hours as well as improving model performance The developed applications and techniques are shared with the whole aviation community to improve effectiveness of ongoing and future machine learning studies',\n"," 'Collaborative machine learning ML is an appealing paradigm to build highquality ML models by training on the aggregated data from many parties However these parties are only willing to share their data when given enough incentives such as a guaranteed fair reward based on their contributions This motivates the need for measuring a partys contribution and designing an incentiveaware reward scheme accordingly This paper proposes to value a partys reward based on Shapley value and information gain on model parameters given its data Subsequently we give each party a model as a reward To formally incentivize the collaboration we define some desirable properties eg fairness and stability which are inspired by cooperative game theory but adapted for our model reward that is uniquely freely replicable Then we propose a novel model reward scheme to satisfy fairness and trade off between the desirable properties via an adjustable parameter The value of each partys model reward determined by our scheme is attained by injecting Gaussian noise to the aggregated training data with an optimized noise variance We empirically demonstrate interesting properties of our scheme and evaluate its performance using synthetic and realworld datasets',\n"," 'Machine learning plays a role in many deployed decision systems often in ways that are difficult or impossible to understand by human stakeholders Explaining in a humanunderstandable way the relationship between the input and output of machine learning models is essential to the development of trustworthy machinelearningbased systems A burgeoning body of research seeks to define the goals and methods of explainability in machine learning In this paper we seek to review and categorize research on counterfactual explanations a specific class of explanation that provides a link between what could have happened had input to a model been changed in a particular way Modern approaches to counterfactual explainability in machine learning draw connections to the established legal doctrine in many countries making them appealing to fielded systems in highimpact areas such as finance and healthcare Thus we design a rubric with desirable properties of counterfactual explanation algorithms and comprehensively evaluate all currentlyproposed algorithms against that rubric Our rubric provides easy comparison and comprehension of the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and serves as an introduction to major research themes in this field We also identify gaps and discuss promising research directions in the space of counterfactual explainability',\n"," 'We present a brief history of the field of interpretable machine learning IML give an overview of stateoftheart interpretation methods and discuss challenges Research in IML has boomed in recent years As young as the field is it has over years old roots in regression modeling and rulebased machine learning starting in the s Recently many new IML methods have been proposed many of them modelagnostic but also interpretation techniques specific to deep learning and treebased ensembles IML methods either directly analyze model components study sensitivity to input perturbations or analyze local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model The field approaches a state of readiness and stability with many methods not only proposed in research but also implemented in opensource software But many important challenges remain for IML such as dealing with dependent features causal interpretation and uncertainty estimation which need to be resolved for its successful application to scientific problems A further challenge is a missing rigorous definition of interpretability which is accepted by the community To address the challenges and advance the field we urge to recall our roots of interpretable datadriven modeling in statistics and rulebased ML but also to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis causal inference and the social sciences',\n"," 'As the decisions made or influenced by machine learning models increasingly impact our lives it is crucial to detect understand and mitigate unfairness But even simply determining what unfairness should mean in a given context is nontrivial there are many competing definitions and choosing between them often requires a deep understanding of the underlying task It is thus tempting to use model explainability to gain insights into model fairness however existing explainability tools do not reliably indicate whether a model is indeed fair In this work we present a new approach to explaining fairness in machine learning based on the Shapley value paradigm Our fairness explanations attribute a models overall unfairness to individual input features even in cases where the model does not operate on sensitive attributes directly Moreover motivated by the linearity of Shapley explainability we propose a meta algorithm for applying existing trainingtime fairness interventions wherein one trains a perturbation to the original model rather than a new model entirely By explaining the original model the perturbation and the faircorrected model we gain insight into the accuracyfairness tradeoff that is being made by the intervention We further show that this meta algorithm enjoys both flexibility and stability benefits with no loss in performance',\n"," 'The unique electronic configuration endows carbon with superflexible bonding ability displaying metallic semiconducting and insulating features with unprecedented applications Inspired by the pressuretemperature phase diagram that clearly shows the phases solidliquidgas of a substance in different conditions for the first time we have derived the electronic phase diagram using machine learning that can discover complex rules and invisible relationships among multivariables Based on SACADA database with threedimensional carbon allotropes electronic band gap is studied by using support vector machine decision tree and multiplelayer perception algorithms It is identified that density and bond angle are two key factors in determining the electronic phase diagram for distinguishing metallic semiconducting and insulating carbon phases where density relates to bond length and coordination number while bond angle relates to orbital orientations both together

clinical signs including the characterization of a variety of motor symptoms However traditional diagnostic approaches may suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify leading to possible misclassification In the meantime early nonmotor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions Therefore these symptoms are often overlooked making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations eg movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes To provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD in this study we conducted a systematic literature review of studies published until February using the PubMed and IEEE Xplore databases A total of studies were included extracted for relevant information and presented in this systematic review with an investigation of their aims sources of data types of data machine learning methods and associated outcomes These studies demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and novel biomarkers in clinical decision making leading to increasingly systematic informed diagnosis of PD',\n"," 'Machine learning has typically focused on developing models and algorithms that would ultimately replace humans at tasks where intelligence is required In this work rather than replacing humans we focus on unveiling the potential of machine learning to improve how people

the length and frequency of study we find that learners whose study sessions are optimized using machine learning remember the content over sim longer than those whose study sessions are generated using two alternative heuristics Our randomized controlled trial also reveals that the learners whose study sessions are optimized using machine learning are sim more likely to return to the app
